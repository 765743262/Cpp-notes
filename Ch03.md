# Chapter 3 Dealing with Data

In this chapter you will learn the following:

* The `climits` file, which represents system limits for various integer types
* Using the `const` qualifier to create symbolic constants
* The `cfloat` file, which represents system limits for various floating-point types
* Automatic type conversions
* Forced type conversions (type cast)

## Simple Variables

Names beginning with two underscore characters or with an underscore character followed by an uppercase letter are reserved for use by the implementation. Names beginning with a single underscore character are reserved for use as global identifiers by the implementation.

Listing 3.1 demonstrates how to use some facilities of the `climits` header file.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	int n_int = INT_MAX;
	short n_short = SHRT_MAX;
	long n_long = LONG_MAX;
	long long n_llong = LLONG_MAX;

	cout << "int is " << sizeof(int) << " bytes." << endl;
	cout << "short is " << sizeof n_short << " bytes." << endl;
	cout << "long is " << sizeof n_long << " bytes." << endl;
	cout << "long long is " << sizeof n_llong << " bytes." << endl;
	cout << endl;

	cout << "Maximum values:" << endl;
	cout << "int: " << n_int << endl;
	cout << "short: " << n_short << endl;
	cout << "long: " << n_long << endl;
	cout << "long long: " << n_llong << endl << endl;

	cout << "Minimum int value = " << INT_MIN << endl;
	cout << "Bits per byte = " << CHAR_BIT << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

#### The `sizeof` Operator and the `climits` Header File

You can apply the `sizeof` operator to a type name or to a variable name. WHen you use the `sizeof` operator with a type name, such as `int`, **you enclose the name in a parentheses**. But when you use the operator with the name of the variable, parentheses are optional.

The `#define` directive only looks for **independent tokens** and skips embedded words. The preprocessor doesn't replace `PINT_MAXIM` with `P32727IM` even if `climit` is included.

#### Initialization

**Initialization combines assignment with declaration**. C++ has an initialization syntax that is not shared with C:

```
int owls = 101;		// traditional C initialization, set owls to 101
int wrens(432);		// alternative C++ syntax, set wrens to 432
```

#### Initialization with C++11

There's another format for initialization that's used with arrays and structures but in C++98 can also be used with single-valued varaibles:

```
int hamburgers = {24};
```

C++11 standard is extending it some ways. 

First, it can be used with or without the `=` sign:

```
int emus{7};
int rheas = {12};
```

Second, the braces can be left empty, in which case the variable is **initialized to 0**:

```
int rocs = {};
int psychics{};
```

Third, it provides better protextion against type conversion errors, a topic we'll return to near the end of this chapter.

### Integer Literals

An integer literal, or constant, is one you write out explicitly.

If you want to display a value in hexadecimal or octal form, you can use some special features of `cout`. Recall that the `iostream` header file provides the `endl` manipulator to give `cout` the message to start a new line. Similarly, in provides the `dec`, `hex`, and `oct` manipulators to give `cout` the message to display integers in decimal, hexadecimal, and octal formats.

```
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	int chest = 42;
	int waist = 42;
	int inseam = 42;

	cout << "Monsieur cuts a striking figure!" << endl;
	cout << "chest = " << chest << " (decimal for 42)" << endl;
	cout << hex;
	cout << "waist = " << waist << " (hexadecimal for 42)" << endl;
	cout << oct;
	cout << "inseam = " << inseam << " (octal for 42)" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Note the code like the following doesn't display anything onscreen:

```
cout << hex;
```

Instead, it changes the way `cout` display integers. Thus, the manipulator `hex` is really a message to `cout` that tells it how to behave. 

Also note because the identifier `hex` is part of the `std` namespace, this program can't use `hex` as the name of a variable. But if you omitted the `using` directive and instead used `std::hex`, you could still use plain `hex` as the name for a variable.

### The `char` Type: Characters and Small Integers

Listing 3.6 illustrate how `cout` handles `char` and `int`. It also introduces a `cout` feature, the `cout.put()` function, which displays single character.

```
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char ch = 'M';
	int i = ch;
	cout << "The ASCII code for " << ch << " is " << i << endl;

	cout << "Add one to the character code:" << endl;
	ch = ch + 1;
	i = ch;
	cout << "The ASCII code for " << ch << " is " << i << endl;

	// using the cout.put() member function to display a char
	cout << "Displaying char ch using cout.put(ch): ";
	cout.put(ch);

	// using cout.put() to display a char constant
	cout.put('!');

	cout << endl << "Done!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

#### A Member Function: `cout.put()`

The `cout.put()` function is a **member function**. Remember that a class defines how to represent data and how to manipulate it. A member function belongs to a class and describes **a method** for manipulating class data. The `ostream` class, has a `put()` member function that is designed to output characters. To use a class member function with an object such as `cout`, you use a period to combine the object name with the function name. The period is called the **membership opertor**.

The `cout.put()` member function provides an alternative to using the `<<` operator to display a character. The reason that there should be such a function is historical.

### The `bool` Type

The ANSI/ISO C++ standard has added a new type (new to C++, that is), called `bool`. In computing, a **Boolean variable** is one whose value can be either `true` or `false`. You can make statments like the following:

```
bool is_ready = true;
```

The literals `true` and `false` can be converted to type `int` by promotion, with `true` converting to 1 and `false` t 0:

```
int ans = true;			// ans assigned 1
int promise = false;  	// promise assigned 0
```

Also any numeric or **pointer** value can be converted implicitly to a `bool` value. **Any nonzero value converts to `true`, whereas a zero value converts to `false`.**

```
bool start = -100;		// start assigned true
bool stop = 0;			// stop assigned false
```

## The `const` Qualifier

C++ provides a better way to define symbolic constant than using the `#define` directive. That way is to use the `const` keyword to modify a variable declaration and initialization. For example,

```
const int Months = 12;
```

Note that you initialize a `const` in the declaration. The following sequence is an error:

```
const int toes;
toes = 10;
```

If you don't provide a value when you declare the constant, it ends up with an unspecified value that you cannot modify.

There some advantages of using `const` over using `#define`:

* It lets you specify the type explicitly.
* You can use C++'s scoping rules to limit the definition to particular functions or files.
* You can use `const` with more elaborate types, such as arrays and structures.

C also provides the `const` keyword. One difference relates to the scope rule. The other main differentce is that in C++ (but not in C), you can use a `const` value to declare the size of an array.

## Floating-Point Numbers

Integer and floating-point types are collectively termed **arithmetic types**.

C++ has three floating-point types: `float`, `double`, and `long double`. These types are in terms of **the number of significant figures** they can represent and the **minimum allowable range of exaponents**. The number of significant is available with the file `cfloat` in both decimal or binary digit unit. For example, one entry from the `cfloat` file is:

```
#define DBL_DIG 15
...
#define DBL_MANT_DIG 53
```

This means that it's guaranteed that the `double` type has at least 15 valid significatn figures, in decimal notation. An the number of bits used to represent the mantissa in `double` is 53.

Listing 3.8 examines how `float` and `double` differ in the precision. The program previews an `ostream` method called `setf()` from Chapter 17. It forces output to stay in **fixed-point notation**. It prevents the program from switching to E notation for large values and causes the program to display six digits to the right of the decimal.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout.setf(ios_base::fixed, ios_base::floatfield);
	float tub = 10.0 / 3.0;
	double mint = 10.0 / 3.0;
	const float million = 1.0e6;

	cout << "tub = " << tub;
	cout << ", a million tubs = " << million * tub;
	cout << ",\nand ten million tubs = ";
	cout << 10 * million * tub << endl;

	cout << "mint = " << mint << " and a million mints = ";
	cout << million * mint << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Normally `cout` drops trailing zeros. The call to `cout.setf()` overrides that behaviour.
## C++ Arithmetic Operators

#### A Glimpse at Operator Overloading

`int` division, `float` division, and `double` division are totally distinct operations. C++ uses the context---in this case the type of operands---to determine which operator is meant. The process of using the same symbol for more that one operation is called **operator overloading**.

### Type Conversion

C++ makes many type conversions automatically:

* C++ converts values when you **assign** a value of one arithmetic type to a variable of another arithmetic type.
* C++ converts values when you combine mixed types in **expressions**.
* C++ converts values when you pass **arguments** to functions.

#### Conversion on Initialization and Assignment

**Any assignment from a numeric type of one type to a varaible of another type is allowed, but some behaviour are well-defined and some are undefined.**

There are only two arithmetic type: integer type and floating-point types. So that are three basic type of conversions:
* Integer to integer
* Floating to floating
* Inter-integer-floating conversion


#### Initialization Conversions When {} Are Used

C++11 calls an initialization that uses braces a **list-initialization**. It's more restrictive in type conversions. It doesn't permit **narrowing**, which is when the type of the varaible may not be able to represent the assigned value. Converions of floating types to integer types are not allowed. Other conversions may be allowed **if the compiler can tell if the target varaible can hold the value correctly**.

#### Conversions in Expressions

C++ makes two kinds of automatic conversions when you combine two different arithmetic types in one expression. First, some types are automatically converted whenever they occur. Second, some types are converted when they are combined with other types in an expression.

See the text for detailed discussions.

#### Conversions in Passing Arguments

Normally, C++ function prototyping controls type conversions for the passing of arguments, as you'll learn in Chapter 7. However, it is possible, usually unwise, to waive prototype control for argument passing. In that case, C++ applies the integral promotions to the `char` and `short` types. And its promotes `float` arguments to `double` when passing them to a function that waives prototyping.

#### Type Casts

The type cast comes in two forms:

```
(typeName) value 	// straght C
typeName (value)    // pure C++
```

The idea behind the new form is to make a type cast look like a function call. This makes type casts for the built-in types look like the type conversions you can design for user-defined classes.

C++ also intrudces four type cast operators that are more restrictive in how they can be used. Chapter 15 covers them. Of the four, the `static_cast<>` operator, can be used for converting values from one numeric type to another. For example,

```
static_cast<long>(thorn)
```

#### `auto` Declaration in C++11

C++11 introduces a facility that allows the compiler to deduce a type from the type of an initlaization value. We'll mention this new meaning of `auto` again later when it becomes more relevant.
