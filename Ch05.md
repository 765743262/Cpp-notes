# Chapter 5: Loops and Relational Expressions

In this chapter you'll learn about the following

* The `get()` character input method
* The end-of-file condition

## Introducing `for` Loops

### Expressions and Statements
The `<<` operator has higher precedence that the operators used in some expressions, so you have to use parentheses to enforce the correct order:

```
cout << (x > 2) << (x = 100);
```

Normally, `cout` converts `bool` values to `int` before displaying them.

The control section section of a `for` structure consisted of three expressions. However, C++ allows you to do things like the following:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
```

**A declaration is not an expression.**. But this is a new type of expression that could appear **only in a `for` statement**: the **declaration-statement expression**.

Consider the following code:

```
double arr[5] = {0};
double * pt = arr;
*pt++;
```

Here, `++` has higher precedence over `*`.

The following program reverses the contents of a `string` class object:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Enter a word: ";
	string word;
	cin >> word;

	char temp;
	int i, j;
	for (j = 0, i = word.size() - 1; j < i; --i, ++j)
	{
		temp = word[i];
		word[i] = word[j];
		word[j] = temp
	}
	cout << word << "\nDone\n";
	return 0;
}
```

Note the location for declaring the variables `temp`, `i`, and `j`. The code declares `i` and `j` before the loop because **you can't combine two declarations with a comma operator**. That's because declaration alrady use the comma for another purpose. However, you can use a **single declaration-statement expression** to create and initiliza two variables:

```
int j = 0, i = word.size() - 1;
```

In this case the comma is just a list separator, not the comma operator, so the expression declares and initializes both `j` and `i`.

You can declare `temp` inside the `for` loop:

```
int temp = word[i];
```

This may result in `temp` being allocated and deallocated in each loop cycle. This might be a bit slower than declaring `temp` once before the loop. But this is not really important.

### Comparing `string` Class Strings

The following program demonstrate how you can apply relational operators to `string` objects:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	string word = "?ate";
	for (char ch = 'a'; word != "mate"; ch++)
	{
		cout << word << endl;
		word[0] = ch;
	}
	cout << "After loop ends, word is " << word << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Note in Listing 5.12, the following test condition uses a relational operator with a `string` object on the left and a C-style string on the right:

```
word != "mate";
```

The way the `string` class overloads the `!=` operator allows you to use it as long as at least one of the operands is a `string` object. The remaining operand can be either a `string` object or a C-style string.

The `string` class design allows you to use a `string` object as a single entity, as in the relational text expression, or as an aggregate object for which you can use array notation to extract individual characters.

## The `while` Loop

Listing 5.13 shows the standard C++ method for processing C-style strings:

```
#include <iostream>
const int ArSize = 20;
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char name[ArSize];
	cout << "Your first name, please: ";
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Here is your name, verticalized and ASCIIized:\n";
	int i = 0;
	while (name[i])
	{
		cout << name[i] << ": " << int(name[i]) << endl;
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
Unlike a C-style string, a `string` class object **doesn't use a null character to identify the end of a string**, so you can't convert Listing 5.13 to a `string` class version merely by replacing the array of `char` with a `string` object.

### Just a Moment---Building a Time-Delay Loop

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Enter the delay time, in seconds: ";
	double secs;
	cin >> secs;
	clock_t delay = secs * CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
	cout << "Starting...\n";
	clock_t start = clock();
	while (clock() - start < delay)
		continue;
	cout << "Done.\n";
	return 0;
}
```

## The Range-Based `for` Loop (C++11)

The C++11 adds a new form of loop called the **ranged-based** `for` loop. I simplifies one common loop task---that of something with each element of an array, or, more generally, of one of the container classes, such as `vector` or `array`. Here is an example:

```
double prices[5] = {4.99, 10.99, 6.87, 7.99, 8.49};
for (double x : prices)
	std::cout << x << std::endl;
```

To modify array values, you need a different syntax for the loop variable:

```
for (double & x: prices)
	x = x * 0.80;
```

The range-based `for` loop also can be used with initialization lists:

```
for (int x : {3, 5, 2, 8, 6})
	cout << x << " ";
cout << '\n';
```

## Loops and Text Input

Let's look at one of the most common and important tasks assigned to loops: reading text character-by-character from a file or from the keyboard.

### Using Unadorned `cin` for Input

Listing shows a probram that reads the input, echo the input, and counts the number of characters:

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Enter characters; enter # to quit:\n";
	char ch;
	cin >> ch;
	int count = 0;
	while (ch != '#')
	{
		cout << ch;
		count++;
		cin >> ch;
	}
	cout << endl << count << " characters read\n";
	return 0;
}
```

There is one problem with this program: when reading type `char` values, just as when reading other basic types, **`cin` skips over spaces and newline charaters**. So the spaces in the input won't be echoed, and they are not counted.

### `cin.get(char)` to the Rescue

Usually, programs that read input character-by-character need ot examine every character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines. The `istream` class includes member functions that meet this function, the `cin.getï¼ˆch)` member function.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Enter characters; enter # to quit:\n";
	char ch;
	cin.get(ch);
	int count = 0;
	while (ch != '#')
	{
		cout << ch;
		count++;
		cin.get(ch);
	}
	cout << endl << count << " characters read\n";
	return 0;
}
```

The `iostream` header file declares the argument to `cin.get(ch)` as a reference type, which allows you to modify the value of `ch`.

### Which `cin.get()` Should You Use?

Listing 4.5 in Chapter 4 uses this code:

```
char name[ArSize];
...
cout << "Enter your name:\n";
cin.get(name, ArSize).get();
```

An most recently, we've used `cin.get()` this way:

```
char ch;
cin.get(ch);
```

This is **function overloading**.

### The End-of-File Condition

In Unix, you press Ctrl+D to simulate the EOF condition.

When `cin` detects the EOF, it sets two bits (the **eofbit** and the **failbit**) to `1`. You can use a member function named `eof()` to see whether the eofbit has been set; the call `cin.eof()` returns the `bool` value `true` if the EOF has been detected and `false` otherwise. Similarly, the `fail()` member function returns `true` if **either the eofbit or the failbit has been set to `1` and `false` otherwise.**

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char ch;
	int count = 0;
	cin.get(ch);
	while (cin.fail() == false)
	{
		cout << ch;
		count++;
		cin.get(ch);
	}
	cout << endl << count << " characters read\n";
	return 0;
}
```

#### EOF Ends Input

When the EOF flag is set, **`cin` does not read anymore input, and further calls to `cin` have no effect.** The `cin.clear()` method clears the EOF flag and lets input proceed again. Chapter 17 discusses this further.

#### Common Idioms for Charater Input

The following is the essential design of a loop intended to read text a character at a time until EOF:

```
cin.get(ch);
while (!cin.fail())
{
	...		// do stuff
	cin.get(ch);
}
```

Another amazing thing is here. The return value for the `cin.get(ch)` method is `cin`, an object. However, the `istream` class provides a function that can **convert an `istream` object such as `cin` to a `bool` value**; this conversion function is called when `cin` occurs in a location where a `bool` is expected, such as in the test condition of a `while` loop. Furthermore, the `bool` value for the conversion is `true` is the last attempted read was successful and `false` otherwise. This means you can rewrite the `while` test look like this:

```
while(cin)
```

This is a bit general than using `!cin.fail()` or `!cin.eof()` because it detects other possible causes of failure, such as disk failure.

Finally, because the return value of `cin.get(char)` is `cin`, you can condense the loop to this format:

```
while (cin.get(ch))
{
	...		// do stuff
}
```


### Yet Another Version of `cin.get()`

The call `cin.get()` and `cout.put(ch)` works like C's `getchar()` and `putchar()`. `get()` return the character read **as a type `int` value**, rather than an object. `put(ch)` accept a `char` value, **but passing an `int` will cause an error**.

When `cin.get()` reaches EOF, there are no more character to be returned. Instead, it returns a special value `EOF`, which typically is defined as the value `-1`. However, there's another problem: you cannot assign that to an unsigned char. Thus the safe way is to use an `int` value to accept the return value of `cin.get()`:

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	int ch;
	int count = 0;

	while ((ch = cin.get()) != EOF)
	{
		cout.put(char(ch));
		++count;
	}
	cout << endl << cout << " characters read\n";
	return 0;
}
```

Using `cin.get(ch)` for input doesn't create any type problems. This form is also integrated more fully into the object approach.
