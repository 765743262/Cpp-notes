# Chapter 2 Setting Out to C++
In this chapter you'll learn about the following:
* The generic format for a C++ program
* Using the `cout` object for output
* How and when to use `endl` 
* Using `cin` object for input

## C++ Initiation

A simple C++ program:

```
// myfirst.cpp -- displays a message

#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Come up and C++ me some time."
	cout << endl;
	cout << "You won't regret it!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

This example has the following elements:
* A `using namespace` directive
* Statements that uses the C++ `cout` facility to display a message

### Features of the `main()` Function

A **function definition** includes:
* a function header
* a function body

C++ uses a semicolon as a **terminator** rather than as a seperator in some languages. The difference is that a semicolon acting as a terminator is **part of the statement** rather than a marker between statements.

Under C++ (**but not C**), leaving the parentheses empty is the same as using `void` in the parentheses. (In C, leaving the parentheses empty means you are remaining silent about whether there are arguments.)

### The `iostream` File

If your program is to use the usual C++ input and output facilities, you provide these two lines:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

`iostream` contains several definitions that enables the use of the `cout` and `cin` facilities.

### Header Files

Old C++ use the same header extension as C. Nowadays, C++ header files have **no** extensions. There are also C header files that have been converted to C++ header files. These files have been renamed by dropping the `h` extension and **prefixing the file name with a `c`** (indicating that it comes from C). For example, the C++ version of `math.h` is `cmath`.

Dropping the `h` is more that a cosmetic change, for the **`h`-free header files also incorporate namespaces**.

### Namespaces

If you use `iostream` instead of `iostream.h`, you should use the following namespace directive to make the definitions in `iostream` available to your program:

```
using namespace std;
```

This is called a **`using` directive**. Here is an overview.

Namespace support is a C++ featuer designed to simplify the writing of large programs and of programs that combing pre-existing code **from several vendors** and to help organize programs. You might use two prepackaged products both have, say, a function called `wanda()`. The namespace facility lets a vendor package its wares in a unit called a **namespace** so that you can use the name of a namespace to indicate which vendor's product you want. Thus, your program could now use the namespaces to discriminate between various versions:

```
Microflop::wanda("go dancing?");
Piscine::wanda("a fish named Desire");
```

The classes, functions and varaibles that are a standard component of C++ compilers are now placed in a namespace called `std`. **This takes place in the `h`-free header files.** This means, the `cout` varaible used for output and defined in `iostream` is really called `std::cout`. Thus, **you can omit the `using` directive and, instead, code in the following style:**

```
std::cout << "Come up and C++ me some time.";
std::cout << std::endl;
```

The following line means you can use names defined in the `std` namespace without using the `std::` prefix:

```
using namespace std;
```

This `using` directive makes all the names in the `std` namespace available. Modern practice regard this as a bit lazy and **potentially a problem in large projects**. The preferred approaches are to use the `std::` quanlifier or to use some thing called a **`using` declaration** to make **just particular names available:**

```
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;
```

If you use these declarations, you can use `cin` and `cout` without attaching `std::` to them. But if you need to use other names from `iostream`, you have to add them to the `using` list individually.

This book initially uses the lazy approach for a couple reason. Later, the book uses the other namespace techniques.

### C++ Output with `cout`

The program uses the following C++ statement:
```
cout << "Come up and C++ me some time.";
```

`cout` is a predefined object that knows how to display a variety of things, including strings, numbers, and individual characters. It represents the **output stream**. The **insertion operator** `<<` inserts the information on its right into the stream.

#### A First Look at Operator Overloading

You may have notice that the insertion operator `<<` looks just like the bitwase left-shift operator. This is an example of **oeprator overloading**, by which the same operator symbol can have different meanings. The compiler uses the context to figure out which meaning is intended.

The important thing here is not the exact function of these operators but the fact that **the same symbol can have more than one meaning, with the compiler determining the proper meaning from the context**.

#### The Manipulator `end` and The Newline Character

Let's examine an odd-looking notation

```
cout << endl;
```

Special notations like `endl` that have particular meanings to `cout` are dubbed **manipulators**. Like `cout`, `endl` is defined in the `iostream` header file and is part of the `std` namespace.

The C notation for such function is the newline character `\n`. One difference is that `endl` guarantees the output will be **flushed**. You don't get that guarantee wit h `\n`.

#### Tokens and White Space in Source Code

The indivisible elements in a line of code are called **tokens**. You must seperate one token from the next with a space, tab, or carriage return, which colletively are termed **white space**. Some single characters, such as parentheses and commas, are tokens that **need not be set off by white space**. 

So in a source code, conceptually, there are only two things:
* tokens
* white spaces

## C++ Statements

Listing 2.2 provides two new kinds of statements, a declaration statment and an assignment statement.

```
// carrots.cpp -- food processing program
// uses and displays a variable

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	using namespace std;

	int carrots;

	carrots = 25;
	cout << "I have ";
	cout << carrots;
	cout << " carrots.";
	cout << endl;
	carrots = carrots - 1;
	cout << "Crunch, crunch. Now I have " << carrot << " carrots." << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

### Declaration Statements and Variables
A declaration statment provides two kinds of information: the type of memory storage needed and a label to attach to that storage.

A declaration statement in the program is called a **defining declaration** statement, or **definition**, if it causes the compiler to allocate memory space for the variable. There are also **reference declaraions**.

**Note: the C++ style for declaring variables is to declare a variable as close to its first use as possible**.

### A New Trick for `cout`

Listing 2.2 also gives `cout` a variable whose value is an integer:

```
cout << carrot;
```

Unlike `printf`, `cout` is clever enough to recognize that `carrots` is an integer that requires conversion. Actually, the C++ insertion operator `<<` adjusts its behavior to fit the type of data that follows it. **This is an example of operator overloading**.

`cout` is extensible. You can redefine the `<<` operator so that `cout` can recognize and display new data types you develop. This will be covered in later chapters.

## More C++ Statements

Listing 2.3 uses `cin`. It also shows yet another way to use the `cout`

```
// getinfo.cpp -- input and output
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	using namespace std;

	int carrots;

	cout << "How many carrots do you have?" << endl;
	cin >> carrots;
	cout << "Here are two more. ";
	carrots = carrots + 2;
// the next line concatenates output
	cout << "Now you have " << carrots << " carrots." << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

### Using `cin`

The following statements read the input:

```
cin >> carrots;
```

Just as C++ considers output to be a stream of characters flowing into the program, it considers input to be a stream of characters flowing into the program. The `iostream` file defines `cin` as an object represents this stream. For input, `cin` uses the `>>` operator to extract characters from the input stream, and put it into the variable on the right of the operator.

Like `cout`, `cin` is a smart object. It convers input, which is just a series of characters, into a form acceptable to the varaible receiving the information.

### Concatenating with `cout`

The second new feature of the program is combining four output statements into one. The `iostream` file defines the `<<` operator so that you can combine (that is, concatenate) output as follows:

```
cout << "Now you have " << carrots << " carrots." << endl;
```

#### `cin` and `cout`: A Touch of Class

A **class** is a data type the user defines. THe class describes all the properties of a data type, including actions that ca nbe performed with it, and an object is an entity created according to that description. For example, `cout` is an object created to have the properties of the `ostream` class. The `ostream` class definition describes the sort of data an `ostream` object represents and the operations you can perform with and to it. Similarly, `cin` is an object created with the properties of the `istream` class, also define in `iostream`.

## Functions
### Placing the `using` Directive in Multifunction Programs

Listing 2.5 places a `using` directive in each of the two functions:

```
// ourfunc.cpp -- defining your own function
#include <iostream>
void simon(int n);

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	simon(3);
	cout << "Pick an integer: ";
	int count;
	cin >> count;
	simon(count);
	cout << "Done!" << endl;
	return 0;
}

void simon(int n)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Simon says touch your toes " << n << "times." << endl;
}
```

This is because each function uses `cout` and thus needs access to the `cout` definition from the `std` namespace.

Another way to make the `std` namespace available to both functions is to place the directive outside and above both functions. However, the current prevalent pholosophy is that it's preferable to be more descriminating and limit access to the `std` namespace to only those functions that need access.

In summary, you have several choices for making `std` namespace available to a program. Here are some:

* Place `using namespace std` above all function definitions in a file, making all contents of the `std` namespace available to every function in the file.

* Place `using namespace std` in a specific function, making all contents of the `std` namespace available to that specific function.

* Instead of `using namespace std`, you can place `using` declaration like the following in a specific function definition and make a particular element, like `cout`, available to that function:

```
using std::cout;
```


* You can omit the `using` directive and declaration entirely and use the `std::` prefix whenever you use elements from the `std` namespace:

```
std::cout << "I'm using cout and endl from the std namespace." << std::endl;
```
