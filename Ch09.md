## Seperate Compilation

### Headers

In C++, compilation of seperate files precedes linkage of them. That is, you compile each files, then link them into the final executalbe file.

If you modify just one file, you can recompile just that one file and then link it to the previously **compiled versions** of the other files.

The original program can be divided into three parts:

* A header file that contains structure declarations and prototypes
* A source code file that contains the code for the **structure-related functions**
* A source code file that contains the code that calls the structure-related fucntions

**Note you cannot put definition in the header** because if the header is included in two files that are part of a single program, you'd wind up with an error. **But structure definition and prototypes can be included several times.**

A standard header file includes:

* Symbolic constants defined using #define or const
* Structure declarations
* Class declarations
* Template declarations
* Function prototypes
* Inline functions

Structure declarations, template declarations, const and inline functions can be placed in header files without causing problems. Only things that create a new entity will cause problems.

### Multiple Library Linking 

C++ Standard allows each compiler designer the latitude to implement name decoration. So the **binary modules (object-code files)** created with different compilers will look different, and thus may not link properly. 

When attempting to link compiled modules, you should make sure that **each object file or library was generated  with the same compiler**.

## Storage Duration, Scope, and Linkage

### Storage Durations

There are three seperate schemes for storing data (four under C++11):

* Automatic stoage duration:

  Variables declared inside a funciton definition including parameters.

* Static storage duration:

  Variables outside a function definition or else by using the keyword statci.

* Dynamic storage duration:

  Memory allocated by the new operator and freed with the delete operator. This memory is sometimes termed _free store_ or the _heap_.

* Thread storage duration (C++11)

### Scope and Linkage

**Scope: visibility in a tranlation unit**

* Local scope
* Global scope
* Function prototype scope
* Class scope
* Namespace scope

The global scope has become a special case of namespace scope.

**Linkage: how a name can be shared in different units

** Internal linkage
** External linkage

**Functions cannot have local scope. And automatic variables have no linkage**

### Automatic Storage Duration

**Automatic  variable is allocated when execution enters the block, but the scope begins only after the point of declaration.**

In C and prior versions of C++ auto is used to explicitly identify a variable as having aotomatic storage. But in C++11, the usage is no longer valid and introduce a new one.

#### Automatic Variables and the Stack

The start and termination of functions can be modelled with a stack, the same as variables.

The program keep track of the stack by using two pointers. One points to the base of the stack and the other to the top points to the next available free space. 

When a call is made, the values is put on the top of the stack. When entering the function called, it associates parameters with this values. When quiting, the pointers altered.

#### Register Variables

Keyword register is originally used to speed up access to a variable. But in C++11, it left as just a way to explicitly identify a varaible as being automatic.

### Static Duration Variables

C++ provide static storage duration variables with three kinds of linkage: 

* External linkage: accessable across files
* Internal linkage: accessible to functions within a single file
* No linkage: accessible to just one function or one block

**Because the number of static variables doesn't change as the program runs, the program doesn't need a special device such as a stack to manage them.**

Static arrays and structures have all the **bits** of each element or member set to 0 by default.

Variables declare outside any block have **external linkage** naturally.

	int global = 1000; // static duration, external linkage
	static int one_file = 50; // static duration, internal linkage

Here, global can also be used in other files that are part of the program.

All unintialized static variable has all its bits set to 0, or _zero-initialized_.

#### Initializing Static Variables.

* _Static initialization_: initialization happends at compile-time. This includes z_ero-initialization and _constant expression initialization_.

* _Dynamic initialization_:
initialization performed at running time. Like:

	const double pi = 4.0 * atan(1.0);

It has to wait until atan is called, which is after the file is compiled and linked.

### Static Duration, External Linkage

Variables with external linkage are often referred to as _external variables. They **necessarily** have static storage duration and file scope. They are also termed _global variables_

#### One Definition Rule (odr)

To use external variable in other functions, you MUST use a _referencing declaration_. But _defining declaration_ can only appear once.

A _referencing declaration uses keyword _extern_ and **does not provide initialization** like

	extern int blem;

This means we are refer to a variable blem defined in other tranlation unit.

C++ offers _scope-resolution operator_(::). Normally, variables with no linkage will hide its global version.
By using _scope-resolution operator(::) like

	::warning

You mean specifically to use the global version of warning

### Static Duration, Internal Linkage

You can

	// file 1
	int error = 20;

	---

	// file 2
	static int error = 5;

### Static Storage Duration, No Linkage

### Specifiers and Qualifiers

Certain keywords, called _storage class specifiers_ and _cv-qualifiers_, provide additional information about storage.

Storage class specifier:

	auto // eliminated in C++11
	register
	static
	extern
	thread_local // C++11
	mutable

Cv-qualifiers

	const
	volatile

_Cv_ stands for const and volatile.

_Volatile_ is used to indicated that this variable may be changed not by this program, and thus prevent some optimization.

_Mutable_ is used to indicate a particular member of a structure or class can be altered even if a particular structure of class is a const.

	struct data
	{
		char name[30];
		mutable int accesses;
	};
	const data = {...}
	veep.accesses++; // allowed

#### More about const

**A const variable has internal linkage by default.

	const int fingers = 10;
	int main(void)
	{
		...
	}

Then fingers can only be used in this file.

**Because of this, you can place const variables in the header files.**

But if you want a constant to have external linkage, you can prefix the declaration with _extern_ like

	extern const int states = 50;

### Functions and Linkage

Like variables, functions have linkage properties.

All functions automatically have static storage duration. **Functions have external linkage**. You can use extern to indicate the function is defined in another file, but unlike variables, this is **optional**.

One definition rule applies to normal funcitons. But **not for inline functions**. That's why inline functions can be included in header files.

#### Where C++ Finds Functions

The compilers will looks in all program files, then in the library files.

### Language Linking

C and C++ have different approach to translate function names. This are called _language linkage_.

	extern "C" void spiff(int);
	extern "C++" void spaff(int);

This will cause functions be tranlated in different names.

### Storage Schemes and Dynamic Allocation

#### Initialization with the new Operator

If you wish to create and initialize storage for one of the built-in types like:

	int *pi = new int (6);
	double * pd = new double (99.99);

In C++11, you can use braces:

	struct where {double x; double y, double z;};
	where * one = new where {2.5, 5.3, 7.2};
	int * ar = new int [4] {2, 4, 6, 7};

#### new: Operators, Functions, and Replacement Functions

The new and new[] operaters call upon two functions:

	void * operator new(std::size_t);
	void * operator new(std::size_t);

There are called _allocation functions_. Similarly, there are _deallocation functions used by delete and delete[]:

	void operator delete(void *);
	void operator delete[](void *);

Then basic statement such as:

	int * pi = new int;

gets translated into something like this:

	int * pi = new(sizeof(int));

And the statement

	int * pa = new int[40];

gets tranlated into something like this:

	int * pa = new(40 * sizeof(int));

Similarly,

	delete pi;

invokes the following function call:

	delete(pi);

C++ terms these functions _replaceable_. That means **you can supply replacement functions for new and delete.**Your code would use the new operator as usual, but the new operator would call upon the replacement new() function.

#### The Placement new Operator

Originally, the new operator will find in the heap a block of memery to handle the memory you request.

The new operator has a variation, called _placement_ new, that allows you to specify the location to be used.

To use placement new, you need to:

* Include new header file
* Use the new with an argument that provides the intended address.

	struct chaff
	{
		char dross[20];
		slag;
	};
	char buffer1[50];
	char buffer2[500];
	int main(void)
	{
		chaff *p1, *p2;
		int *p3, *p4;
		p1 = new chaff; // place structure in heap
		p3 = new int[20]; // place int array in heap
		p2 = new (buffer1) chaff; // place structure in buffer1
		p4 = new (buffer2) int [20]; // place int array in buffer2
	}

Actually placement new function does nothing other than **return the address passed to it, type casting it to void * so that it can be assign to any pointer type.**But that's the default placement new.

You don't need delete to free this memory. Actually you can't.

Just as regular new invokes a new function with one argument, the standard placement new invokes a new funciton with two arguments:

	int * p2 = new (buffer) int; // invokes new(sizeof(int), buffer);

The placement new function tis not replaceable, but it can be overloaded.

## Namespaces

### Tranditional C++ Namespaces

Some terminology:

* _Declarative region_: the smallest region you cannot declare a second variable with the same name. This is usually relevant to linkage

* _Potential scope_: the area in program you can accees the variable somehow

* _Scope_: the portion of the program where you can actually access the variable. It doesn't include a block where it's "hidden".

### New Namespaces Features

C++ adds the ability to create **named** namespaces by defining a new kind of declarative region.

**The names in one namespace don't conflict with the same name declared in other namespaces.**

	namespace Jack {
		double pail;
		void fetch();
		int pal;
		struct Well { ... };
	} 
	namespace Jill {
		double bucket(double n) { ... }
		double fetch;
		int pal;
		struct Hill { ... };
	}

Namespaces can be located at the global level or inside other namespaces, but they cannot be placed in a block. Thus a name declared in a namespace has **external linkage by default** (unless it refers to a constant).

In addition to user-defined namespaces, there is one more namespace, the _global namespace_. _Global variables_ are described as being part of the global namespace.

In above-mention example, _fetch_ in _Jack_ can coexist with the _fetch_ in Jill, and _Hill_ in Jill can coexist with an external _Hill_.

Namespaces are open, that means you can add names to existing namespace like:

	namespace Jill {
		char * goose(const char *);
	}

	namespace Jacl {
		void fetch(void)
		{
			...
		}
	}

You can access names in a given namespaces using ::, the _scope-resolution_ operator to _qualify_ a name with its namespace:

	Jack::pail = 12.34;
	Jill::Hill mole;
	Jack::fetch();

An unadorned name such as pail is termed _unqulified name_, whereas a name with the namespace, as in Jack::pail, is termed a _qualified name_

#### _using_ Declarations and _using_ Directives

C++ provides two machanisms, the _using declaration_ and the _using directive_ to simplify using namespace names.

You can regard using declaration and using directive as adding the names to current declarative region, which can also be a namespace like global. For example

	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main(void)
	{
		::cout << "Not an error\n";
	}

will be correct.

The only difference is, if you use using directive, the variable with the same name will overrides that. For exmaple,

	int main(void)
	{
		using namespace std;
		double cout;
	}

Then cout will be double. But if you use 
	
	int main(void)
	{
		using std::cout;
		double cout;
	}

It will be an error.

But what I don't understand is

	using namespace std;
	double cout;
	double cin;
	int main(void)
	{
		::cout >> "not an error\n";
		cin << "error"
	}

That using cin will cause an error.

The using declaration is safer to use than using directive. Because it's hard to know what you have added to the declarative region, and they can be overrode unexpectedly. But that will be an error when you use using declaration.

#### More Namespace Features

You can nest namespace declarations, like:

	namespace elements
	{
		namespace fire
		{
			int flame;
			...
		}
		float water;
	}

You can refer to flame variable as

	elements::fire::flame

And you can make the inner names available with this using directive:

	using namespace elements::fire

Also you can use using directives and using declarations inside namespaces, like this:

	namespace myth
	{
		using Jill:fetch;
		using namespace elements;
		using std::cout;
		using std::cin;
	}

Then Jill:fetch can be accessed by:

	std::cin >> myth::fetch

And 

	using namespace myth;
	cin >> fetch;

You can create an alias for a namespace. Suppose you have a namespace defined as foloows:

	namespace a { ... };

You can make b an alias for a by using the following statement:

	namespace b = a;

You can use this technique to simplify using nested namespaces:

	namespace EMF = myth::elements::fire;
	using MEF::flame;

#### Unnamed Namespaces

You can create an _unnamed namespace_ by omitting the namespace name:

	namespace
	{
		int ice;
		int bandycoot;
	}

The code behaves as if it were followed by a using directive. That is, name "ice" and "bandycoot" are added to the namespace that contains this namespace.

**You can't use names from an unnamed namespace in a file other than the one that contains the namespace declaration.**This provides an alternative to using static variables with internal linkage.For example,

	static int counts;

Can be replaced by
	
	namespace
	{
		int counts;
	}

If you want to use a using declaration to import a function, you just need:
	
	using myth::fucn;

Note return type and signature and omitted.**If the function has overloaded versions, all of them will be imported.**

### Namespaces and the future

As programmers become more familiar with namespaces, common programming idioms will emerge. Here are some guidelines:

	* Use variables in a named namespace instead of using external global variables
	* Use variables in an unnamed namespace instead of using internal global variables
	* If you develop a library of functions or classes, place them in a namespace.
	* Use the using directive **only as a temporary means of converting old code to namespace usage.**
	* Don't use using directives in header files.
	* Preferentially import names by using the scope-resolution operator or a using declaration
	* Preferentially use local scope instead of global scope for using declarations.


## Exercises

Standard way to input:

	while (!(std::cin >> c.slag))
    {
        std::cout << "Please enter a integer.\n";
        std::cin.clear();
        while (std::cin.get() != '\n')
            continue;
    }
    while (std::cin.get() != '\n')
        continue;
