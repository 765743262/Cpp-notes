C++ provides a better method than direct code modification for extending and modifying classes. This method, called _class inheritance_, lets you derive new classes form old ones. Here are some things you can do with inheritance:

* You can add functionality to an existing class.
* You can add to the data the a class repersents.
* You can modify how a class method behaves.

If you purchase a class library that provides only the header files and the compiled code for class methods, you can still derive new classes based on the library classes.
