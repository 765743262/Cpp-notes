# Chapter 10 Objects and Classes

In this chapter you'll learn about the following:

* Procedual and object-oriented programming
* The concept of classes
* How to define and implement a class
* Public and private class
* Class data members
* Class methods (also called class function members)
* Creating and using class objects
* Class constructors and destructors
* _const_ member functions
* The _this_ pointer
* Creating arrays of objects
* Class scope
* Abstract data types

The following are the most important OOP features:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation and data hiding
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Reusability of code

## Procedual and Object-Oriented Programming

With a procedual approach, you first concentrate on the procedures you will follow and then think about how to represent the data.

With an OOP approach, you concentrate on the object as the user perceives it, thingking about the data you need to describe the object and the operations that will describe the user's interaction with the data.

## Abstraction and Classes

Life is full of complexities, and one way we cope with complexity is to **frame simplifying abstractions**.

In OOP, **you abstract the essential operational features of a problem and express a solution in those terms.

### What Is a Type?

Specifying a basic type does three things:

* It determines how much memory is needed for a data object.
* It determines how the bits in the memory are interpreted.
* It determines **what operations, or methods, can be performed using the data object**.

One important part of our thinking is **how we define things**. And the thing "type", is well and completely defined with these three pieces.

### Classes in C++

A _class_ is a C++ vehicle for **tranlating an abstraction to user-defined type**. It combines

* data representation
* methods for manipulating that data

into one neat package.

Generally, a class specification has two parts:

* A _class declaration_, which describes
	* the data component, in terms of data members
	* the public interface, in terms of member functions, termed _methods_

* The _class method definitions_, which describe how certain class member functions are implemented.

#### What Is an Interface?

An _interface_ is a shared framework for **interactions between two systems*. For example, keyboard and mouse are the interface between you and a word processor. You press a key, move or click the mouse, and something weird happens to the paragraph you are typing. **The program interface manages the conversion of your intentions to specific information stored in the computer**

For classes, we speak of the public interface. The public is the program using the class, the interacting system consists of the class objects, and the interface consists of the methods provided by whoever wrote the class.

The interface enables you to **interact** with class objects, and thus it enables the program to use the class objects.

For example, to find out the number of characters in a _string_ object, you don't open up the object to see what's inside. You just use the size() method provided by the class creators.

Listing 10.1

	#ifndef STOCK00_H_
	#define STOCK00_H_

	#include <string>

	class Stock
	{
	private:
	    std::string company;
	    long shares;
	    double share_val;
	    double total_val;
	    void set_tot() { total_val = shares * share_val; }
	public:
	    void acquire(const std::string & co, long n, double pr);
	    void buy(long num, double price);
	    void sell(long num, double price);
	    void update(double price);
	    void show();
	};

	#endif

_Stock_ is the type name for this new class. This declaration enables you to declare variables, called _objects_, or _instances_, **of the Stock type**, like

	Stock sally;
	Stock solly;

Notice that the information you decided to store appears in the form of class data members, such as _company_ and _shares_.

Similarly, the desired operations appear as class function members (or methods), such as sell() and update().

A member funciton can be defined in place, for example,

	void set_tot() { total_val = shares * share_val; }

Or they can be represented by prototypes. The full definitions for the other member functions come later in the implementation file, but the prototypes suffice to describe the function interfaces.

**The binding of data and methods into a single unit is the most striking feature of the class**. Because of this design, creating a _Stock_ object automatically establishes the rules governing how that object can be used.

### Access Control

Keywords _private_ and _public_ describes _access control_ for class members. Any program that uses an object of a particular class can access the public portions directly. **A program can access the private members of an object _only_ by using the public member functions.

For example, the only way to alter the _shares_ member of the _Stock_ class is to use the _Stock member functions.

**The public member functions provide interface between object and program.**

**This insulation of data from direct access by a program is called _data hiding_.**

A class design attempts to separate the public interface from the specifics of implementation. **The public interface represents the abstraction component of the design**.

**Gathering the implementation details together and separating them from the abstraction is called _endcapsulation_. **

_Data hiding_ (putting data into the private section of a class) is an instance of encapsulation because **it hides the intension, or structure or essence or real definition of an object, only lefts a well-defined entity. So is hiding functional details of an implementation in the private section.

### OOP and C++

Actually you can use OOP with any language, like C. But C++ includes features specifically intended to implement the OOP aproach.

* Placing the data representation and the function prototypes into a single class declaration instead of keeping them separate unifles the description by placing everything in one class declaration.

* Making the data representation private enforces the stricture that **data is accessed only by authorized functions.** In C this is not the case.

Note that data hiding not only prevents you from accessing data directly, but it also **absolves you from needing to know how the data is represented. Some value may be stored as variable, or may be calculated when needed, but both approach share the same interface.

#### Member Access Control: Public or Private?

Normally, data items go into the private section. The member functions that constitutes the class interface go into the public section. You can also place member functions in the private section. **You can call such functions directly, but the public methods can use them**.

You don't have to use the keyword _private_ in class declaration because that is the default access control for class objects.

#### Classes and Structures

In fact, C++ extends to structures the same features classes have. **The only difference is that the default acces type for a structure is public, whereas the default type for a class is private.** C++ programmers commonly use classes to implement class description while restricting structures to representing **pure data objects (often called _plain-old data_ structures, or _POD_ structures.)**

### Implementing Class Member Functions

Member function definitions are much like regular function definitions. But they also have two special characteristics:

* When you define a member function, **you use the scope-resolution operator (::) to identify the class to which the function belongs**.
* Class methods can access the private components of the class.

First, the header for update() member function looks like this:

	void Stock::update(double price);

The scope-resolution operator resolves the identity of the class to which a method definition applies. We say the identifier update() has _class scope_. **Other member functions of the Stock can, if necessary, use the update() method without using the scope-resolution operator.**

**Using update() outside the class declaration and method difinitions, requires special measures.**

Stock::update() is called the _qualified name_ of the function. A simple update(), is and abbreviation (the unqualified name) for the full name.

The second characteristic of the method is that a method can access the private members of a class. For example, the show() method can use code like this:

	std::cout << "Company: " << company
			  << "  Shares:" << shares << endl
			  << "  Share Price: $" << share_val
			  << "  Total Worth: $" << total_val << endl;

Here, company, shares and so on are private data members of the Stock class.

	Listing 10.2

	#include <iostream>
	#include "a.hpp"

	// Using scope-resolution operator to identify the class
	void Stock::acquire(const std::string & co, long n, double pr)
	{
	    company = co;
	    if (n < 0)
	    {
	        std::cout << "Number of shares can't be negative; "
	                  << company << "shares set to 0.\n";
	        shares = 0; 
	    }
	    else
	        shares = n;
	    share_val = pr;
	    set_tot();
	}

	void Stock::buy(long num, double price)
	{
	    if (num < 0)
	    {
	        std::cout << "Number of shares purchased can't be negative. "
	                  << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        share += num;
	        share_val = price;
	        set_tot();
	    }
	}

	void Stock::sell(long num, double price)
	{
	    using std::cout;
	    if (num < 0)
	    {
	        cout << "Number of shars sold can't be negative. "
	             << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
	    }
	    else if (num > shares)
	    {
	        cout << "You can't sell more than you have! "
	             << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
	    }

	    else
	    {
	        shares -= num;
	        share_val = price;
	        set_tot();
	    }
	}

	void Stock::update(double price)
	{
	    share_val = price;
	    set_tot();
	}

	void Stock::show()
	{
	    std::cout << "Company: " << company
	              << "  Shares: " << shares << '\n'
	              << "  Share Price: $" << share_val
	              << "  Total Worth: $" << total_val << '\n';
	}

#### Inline Methods

**Any function with a definition in the class declaration automatically becomes an inline function**. For example, Stock::set_tot() is an inline function.

You can make a member function outside the class declaration and still make it inline. To do so, you just use the inline qulifier **in the class implementation section**:

	class Stock
	{
	private:
		...
		void set_tot(); // definition kept separate
	public:
		...
	};

	inline void Stock::set_tot()
	{
		total_val = shares * share_val;
	}

Note the definition of inline function must **immediately** follow the class declaration, in the same header file. We must do this bacause the special rules for inline functions require that **they be defined in each file in which they are used.**

#### Which Object Does a Method Use

Suppose you create two Stock objects:

	Stock kate, joe

In order to use a member function, you can use the membership operator as with structures and structure members:

	kate.show();
	joe.show();

The first call invokes show() as a member of the kate object. This means the method **interprets shares as kate.shares and share_val as kate.share_val.**

That is, **when you call a member function, it uses the data members of the particular object used to invoke the member function.**

Each new object you create contains storage for its own internal variables, the class members. But all objects of the same class share the same set of class methods, with just one copy of each method. That is, kate.show() and joe.show() **both execute the same block of code.** They just apply the code to different data.

Calling a member function is what some OOP languages term _sending a message_. Thus, **sending the same message to two different objects invokes the same method but applies it to two different objects.

### Using Classes

The C++ goal is to make using classes as similar as possible to using the basic, built-in types. For example, you can

* Create a class object by declaring a class variable
* Using new to allocate an object of a class type.
* Pass objects as arguments, return them as function return values
* Assign one object to another

C++ also provides facilities for initializing objects, teaching cin and cout to recognize objects, and even providing automatic type conversions between objects of similar classes.

Listing 10.3

	#include <iostream>
	#include "a.hpp"

	int main(void)
	{
		Stock fluffy_the_cat;
		fluffy_the_cat.acquire("NanoSmart", 20, 12.50);
		fluffy_the_cat.show();
		fluffy_the_cat.buy(15, 18.125);
		fluffy_the_cat.sell(400, 20.00);
		fluffy_the_cat.show();
		fluffy_the_cat.buy(300000, 40.125);
		fluffy_the_cat.show();
		fluffy_the_cat.sell(300000, 0.125);
		fluffy_the_cat.show();
		return 0;
	}

##### The Client/Server Model

*_Client_: a program that uses the class.
*_Server_: the class declaration, including class methods.

The client uses the server through the publicly defined interface only.

The client' programmer's only responsibility, is to know that interface. **That is, the client only knows the fact that "I can define an object of a set" and "I can make tranformation on this set" without having to know how the object is defined, and how the transformation is implemented.**

The server's responsibility, or the server's designer's responsibility, is to see that the server reliably and accurately performs **according to the interface**. **Any changes the server designer makes to the class design should be to details of implementation, not to the interface

### Changing the Implementation

If you want to refine your implementation, you are supposed to make sure that the changes should affect other parts of the **client program**. For example, you may change the formatting like this:

	std::cout.setf(std::ios_base::fixed, std::ios_base::floatfield);
	std::cout.precision(3);

These format changes just mentioned stay in place until change again, so the could **affect subsequent output in the client program. Therefore, the polite thing for show() to do is to reset the formating information to the state that existed before show() was called:

	std::streamsize prec = std::cout.precision(3);
	...
	std::cout.precision(prec)
	

	std::ios_base::fmtflags orig = std::cout.setf(std::ios_base::fiex);
	...
	std::cout.setf(orig, std::ios_base::floatfield);

### Reviewing Our Story to Date

* Provide a class declaration
	* Includes data members and function members
	* Has a private section, where members declared in this section can only be accessed through the member functions.
	* Has a public section, where members can be accessed directly by a program using class objects.

  Typically, data members go into the private section and member functions go into the public section, so a typical class declaration has this form:

  	class _className_
  	{
  	private:
  		data member declarations
  	public:
  		member function prototypes
  	};

  The contents of the public section constitutes the abstract part of the design, the public _interface_). Encapsulating data in the private section protests the integrity of the data and is called _data hiding_.

* Implement the class member functions
	
  You can provide definition instead of a function prototype in the class definition or **immediately define the function after the class declaration. Both these ways make the definition inline.

  The usual practice is to provide the function definitions seperately. In that case, the scope-resolution operator is needed to identify to which class a member function belongs. A function header would look like this:

  	char * Bozo::Retort();

  In other words, Retort() is not just a type char * function; it is a type char * function that belongs to the Bozo class. The full, or _qualified_ name of the function is Bozo::Retort().

  The name Retort has class scope, so the scope-resolution operator is needed to qualify the name when it is used **outside the class declaration and a class method**.

* Create an object

  Because a class is a user-defined type, you can create an object just like this:

  	Bozo bozetta

  You invoke a class member function or method, by using a class object:

  	bozetta.Retort();

  Whenever the code for that function refers to a particular data member, the function uses the value that member has in the bozetta object.


##### About Abstraction

_Abstraction_ is a set, especially when the objects have isomorphism between them, which defined an abstraction. Then we can use one object and isomorphism to define the abstraction. Typically, we use object constructed within the plain set theory.

In programming, we have pre-defined and well-defined sets and object.

If the abstraction want to represent can be represented as a composite of other sets, then we are done.

We can represent tranformation of this set via transformation of component sets.

Pre-defined sets:

* Numbers: int, double, float
* Relations: pointers.

## Class Constructors and Destructors

You can initialize a structure like:

	struct thing
	{
		char *pn;
		int m;
	}
	thing amabob = {"wodget", -23};

But you can do this with calss

	Stock hot = {"Suikie's Autos, Inc.", 200, 20.25};

The reason you can initialzize a Stock object this way is because the data parts have private access status. 

C++ provides for special member functions, called _class constructors_ for constructing new objects and assigning values to their data members.

**C++ provides a name for these member functions and a syntax for using them.

### Declaring and Defining Constructors

A Stock object has three values to be provided from the outside world, so you should give the constructor three arguments. Possibly, you may want to provide just the company member value and set other values to zero by default arguments. The prototype would look like this:

	Stock(const string & co, long n = 0, double pr = 0);

Note the constructor **has no return type**. The protyotype goes into the **public section** of the class declaration

Here's one definition for the constructor:

	Stock::Stock(const string & co, long n, double pr)
	{
		company = co;

		if (n < 0)
		{
			std::cerr << "Number of shares can't be negative; "
					  << company << " shares set to 0.\n";
			shares = 0;
		}
		else
			shares = n;
		share_val = pr;
		set_tot();
	}

Note this is the same code that the acquire() function used earlier in this chapter. The difference is that in this case, a program **automatically inivokes the constructor when it declares an object.**

##### Member Names and Parameter Names

Often those new to constructors try to use the class member names as parameter names in the constructor, as in the example:

	Stock::Stock(const string & company, long shares, double share_val)
	{
		...
	}

This is wrong. Otherwise you end up with confusing code like this:

	shares = shares

One common coding practice to help avoid such confusion is to use m_ prefix like:

	class Stock
	{
	private:
		string m_company;
		long m_shares;
		...
	}

Another common practice is to use an underbar suffix for member names:

	class Stock
	{
	private:
		string company_;
		long shares_;
	}

### Using Constructors

C++ provides two ways in initialize an object by using a constructor. The first is to call the constructor explicitly:

	Stock food = Stock("World Cabbage", 250, 1.25);

The second way is to call th constructor implicitly:

	Stock garment("Furry Mason", 50, 2.5);

This is equivalent to the explicit call.

C++ uses a class constructor whenever you create an objecct of that class, evne when **you use _new_ for dynamic memory allocation**. Here's how to use the constructor with new:

	Stock * pstock = new Stock("Electroshock Games", 18, 19.0);

This statement creates a Stock object and initialize it to the value provided, and assign its address to the pstock pointer.

**You can't use an object to invoke a constructor** because until the constructor finishes its work of making the object, there is no object. **Rather than invoked by an object, the constructor is used to create the object**.

### Default Constructors

A _default constructor_ is a constructor that is used to create an object when you don't provide explicit initialization values, like:

	Stock fluffy_the_cat

In this case, a default constructor is used.

**If you failed to provide any constructors, C++ automatically supplies a default constructor that does nothing. For the Stock class, the default constructor would look like this:

	Stock::Stock() {}

The effect is that the object is created with its members uninitialized.

The compiler provides this default default constructor **only if you don't define any constructor.** If you provide any nondefault constructor, then a declaration like this becomes an error:

	Stock stock1;

If you provide a nondefault constructor and wish to create an object without explicit initialization, **you must define your own default constructor.

One way is to provide default values for **all** the arguments to the existing constructor:

	Stock(const string & co = "Error", int n = 0, double pr = 0.0)

The second is to **use function overloading** to define a second constructor, one that has no arguments:

	Stock();

You can have **only one default constructor**, so be sure you **don't do both.** You should usually initialize objects in order to ensure all members begin with known, reasonable values. Thus, a user-defined default constructor typically provides implicit initialization for all member values. For example, this is how you might define one for the Stock class:

	Stock::Stock()
	{
		company = "No name";
		shares = 0;
		share_val = 0.0
	}

##### Tip

	**When you design a class, you should usually provide a default constructor that implicitly initializes all class members**.

After you've used either method (no arguments or default values for all arguments) to create the default constructor, you can declare an object without initializing it explicitly:

	Stock first;
	Stock first = Stock();
	Stock * prelief = new Stock;

However, **you shouldn't be misled by the implicit form of the nondefault constructor**:

	Stock second(); // declares a funciton

**This will declare a new function that returns a Stock object.**

**So when you implicitly call the default constructor, you don't use parentheses.

### Destructors

A _destructor is a special member function which clean up all debris when the object expires. For example, if your constructor uses new to allocate memory, the destructor should use delete to free that memory.

Like constructor, a destructor has a special name: It is formed from the class name preceded by a tilde (~). And like a constructor, a destructor can have no return value. Unlike a constructor, a destructor **must have no arguments. Thus, the prototype for a Stock destructor must be this:
	
	~Stock();

Because a Stock destructor has no vital duties, you can code it as a do-nothing function, or add something to it:

	Stock::~Stock()
	{
		std::cout << "Bye, " << company << "!\n";
	}

If you don't provide any destructor, the compiler will **generate an implicit, do-nothing destructor**.

Your code **shouldn't explicitly call a destructor**. There are three cases that a destructor will be called:

* If you create an automatic storage class object, its destructor is called when the program exits the block of code in which the object is defined.

* If you create an static storage class object, its destructor is called when the program terminates

* If the object is created by using `new`, its destrutor is called when you use `delete`, to free the momery.

Finally, a program can create temporary objects. In that case, destructor is called when it has finished using it.

### Improving the `Stock` Class

Listing 10.4

``` C
#ifndef STOCK10_H_
#define STOCK10_H_

#include <string>

class Stock
{
private:
    std::string company;
    long shares;
    double share_val;
    double total_val;
    void set_tot() { total_val = shares * share_val; }
public:
    // two constructors
    Stock();
    Stock(const std::string & co, long n = 0, double pr = 0.0);
    // destructor
    ~Stock();
    void buy(long num, double price);
    void sell(long num, double price);
    void update(double price);
    void show();
};
#endif 
```

Listing 10.4 shows the header files. Note **we need to place the prototype of our constructor and destructor in the class declaration like this:

``` C
Stock();
Stock(const std::string & co, long n = 0, double pr = 0.0);
~Stock();
```

Listing 10.5

``` C
#include <iostream>
#include "a.hpp"


// constructors
// default
Stock::Stock()
{
    std::cout << "Default constructor called\n";
    company = "no name";
    shares = 0;
    share_val = 0.0;
    total_val = 0.0;
}

Stock::Stock(const std::string & co, long n, double pr)
{
    std::cout << "Constructor using " << co << " called\n";
    company = co;

    if (n < 0)
    {
        std::cout << "Number of shares can't be negative; "
                  << company << " shares set to 0.\n";
        shares = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        shares = n;
    }
    share_val = pr;
    set_tot();
}

// class destructor
Stock::~Stock()
{
    std::cout << "Bye, " << company << "!\n";
}

// Using scope-resolution operator to identify the class

void Stock::buy(long num, double price)
{
    if (num < 0)
    {
        std::cout << "Number of shares purchased can't be negative. "
                  << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
    }
    else
    {
        shares += num;
        share_val = price;
        set_tot();
    }
}

void Stock::sell(long num, double price)
{
    using std::cout;
    if (num < 0)
    {
        cout << "Number of shars sold can't be negative. "
             << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
    }
    else if (num > shares)
    {
        cout << "You can't sell more than you have! "
             << "Transaction is aborted.\n";
    }

    else
    {
        shares -= num;
        share_val = price;
        set_tot();
    }
}

void Stock::update(double price)
{
    share_val = price;
    set_tot();
}

void Stock::show()
{
    using std::cout;
    using std::ios_base;
    ios_base::fmtflags orig = cout.setf(ios_base::fixed, ios_base::floatfield);
    std::streamsize prec = cout.precision(3);
    std::cout << "Company: " << company
              << "  Shares: " << shares << '\n'
              << "  Share Price: $" << share_val
              << "  Total Worth: $" << total_val << '\n';

    cout.setf(orig, ios_base::floatfield);
    cout.precision(prec);
}   
```

In Listing 10.5 we define the constructor and destructor.

Listing 10.6

``` C
#include <iostream>
#include "a.hpp"

int main(void)
{
	{
		using std::cout;
		cout << "Using constructors to create new objects\n";
		Stock stock1("NanoSmart", 12, 20.0);
		stock1.show();
		Stock stock2 = Stock("Boffo Objects", 2, 2.0);
		stock2.show();

		cout << "Assigning stock1 to stock2:\n";
		stock2 = stock1;
		cout << "Listing stock1 and stock2:\n";
		stock1.show();
		stock2.show();

		cout << "Using a constructor to reset an object\n";
		stock1 = Stock("Nifty Foods", 10, 50.0);
		cout << "Revised stock1:\n";
		stock1.show();
		cout << "Done\n";
	}

	return 0;
}
```

Listing 10.6 illustra some very important properties.

The extra brace is use to make the message in the destructor appear before the window close.

Note the two syntax to initialize an object:

``` C
Stock stock1("NonaSmart", 12, 12,0)
```

and

``` C
Stock stock2 = Stock ("Boffo Objects", 2, 2.0);
```

The C++ Standard gives a compiler a couple ways to execute the second syntax. One is to make ti behave exacly like the first syntax. The second way is to **create a temporary object** that is then copied to `stock2`. **Then the temporary object is discarded, and call the desctructor.**

**In this case, if destructor does something like displaying some message, the message will appear.**

The compiler may dispose of the temporary object immediately, or wait longer, in which case the destructor message will be displayed later.

The code illustrates that you can assign one object to another of the same type:

``` C
stock2 = stock1;
```

By default C++ copies the content of each **data member** of the source object ot the corresponding data member of the target object.

You can use the constructor for more than initializing a new object. For example:

``` C
stock1 = Stock("Nifty Foods", 10, 50.0);
```

It does so by having the constructor **create a new, temporary object** and then copying the contenst of the new object to `stock1`, and then dispose of the temporary immediately or later.

When the `main()` function terminates, the two object is deleted. And **the last object created is the first deleted**. The destructor is called accordingly.

Note in both cases of initialization of a new object or assigning new values to an object, a temporary object might be created. But there is a fundamental difference between the following two statements:

``` C
Stock stock2 = Stock ("Boffo Object", 2, 2.0);
stock1 = Stock("Nifty Foods", 10, 50.0);
```

**The first statement may or may not create a temporary object. The second statement always cause the creation of a temporary object before assignment occers.**

Actually you can regard this

	``` C
	Stock("A", 2, 2)
	```

**As an expression of `Stock` type. It creates a temporary `Stock` object, and then dispose of it and call the destrucotr**. But when it comes to initialization, it may optimized and no temporary object is created.
