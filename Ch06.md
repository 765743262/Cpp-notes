# Chapter 6 Branching Statements and Logical Operators

In this chapter you'll learn about the following:

* The `cctype` library of character functions
* Basic file input/outptu

## Logical Expressions

C++ provides that the `||` operator is a **sequence point**.

### Alternative Representations

The C++ Standard provides alternative representations for logical operators, as shown in the Table. The identifiers `and`, `or`, and `not` are C++ reserved words, meaning that you can't use them as names for variables and so on.

Operator | Alternative Representation
--- | ---
&& | and
\|\| | or
! | not

### Using Enumerators as `switch` Labels

Listing 6.11 illustrates using `enum` to define a set of related constants and then using the constants in a `switch` statement. In general, `cin` doesn't recognize enumerated types, so the program reads the choice as an `int`. When the `switch` statement compares the `int` value to an enumerator case label, **it promotes the enumerator to `int`. Also the enumerators are promoted to type `int` in the `while` loop text condition.**

```
#include <iostream>

enum {red, orange, yellow, gree, blue, violet, indigo};

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Enter color code (0-6): ";
	int code;
	cin >> code;
	while (code >= red && code <= indigo)
	{
		switch (code)
		{
			case red:
				cout << "Her lips were red.\n";
				break;
			case orange:
				cout << "Her hair was orange.\n";
				break;
			case yellow:
				cout << "Her shoes were yello.\n";
				break;
			case green:
				cout << "Her nails were green.\n";
				break;
			case blue:
				cout << "Her sweatsuit was blue.\n";
				break;
			case violet:
				cout << "Her eyes were violet.\n";
				break;
			case indigo:
				cout << "Her mood was indigo.\n";
				break;
		}
		cout << "Enter color code (0-6): ";
		cin >> code;
	}
	cout << "Bye\n";
	return 0;
}
```

## Number-Reading Loops

Consider the following code:

```
int n;
cin >> n;
```

What happends wif the user responds by entering a word instead of a number? Four things occur in such a mismatch:
* The value of `n` is left unchanged.
* The mismatched input is left in the input queue
* An error flag is set in the `cin` object
* The call to the `cin` method, if converted to type `bool`, returns `false`

The fact that the method returns `false` means that you can use non-numeric input to terminate a number-reading loop. The fact that non-numeric input sets an error flag means that you have to reset the flag before the program can read more input, which can be done with the `clear()` method.

Suppose you are required to submit exactly five golf scores to a C++ program to establish your average. If a user enters non-numeric input, the program should object, insisting on numeric input. If needs to take three steps:

1. Reset `cin` to accept new input
2. Get rid of the bad input
3. Prompt the user to try again

```
#include <iostream>
const int Max = 5;
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;

	int golf[Max];
	cout << "Please enter your golf scores.\n";
	cout << "You must enter " << Max << " rounds.\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < Max; i++)
	{
		cout << "round #" << i + 1 << ": ";
		while (!(cin >> golf[i]))
		{
			cin.clear();
			while (cin.get() != '\n')
				continue;
			cout << "Please enter a number: ";
		}
	}
	double total = 0.0;
	for (int i = 0; i < Max; i++)
		total += golf[i];
	cout << total / Max << " = average score "
		 << Max << " rounds\n";
	return 0;
}
```

The heart of the error-handling code in Listing 6.14 is the following+

```
while (!(cin >> golf[i]))
{
	cin.clear();
	while (cin.get() != '\n')
		continue;
	cout << "Please enter a number: ";
}
```

## Simple File Input/Output

C++ makes it simple to transfer the skills you've acquired for keyboard input and display output (collectively termed **console I/O**) to file input and output (**file I/O**). Chapter 17 explores these topics more extensively, but we'll look at simple text file I/O now.

### Text I/O and Text Files

This section examine the concept of text I/O and is good for review. The main point here is that all the input starts out as text. The file I/O discussed in this chapter parallels console I/O and thus should be used with text files.

### Writing to a Text File

To prepare for file outputs, let's review some basic facts about using `cout` for console output:

* You must include the `iostream` header file.
* The `iostream` header file defines an `ostream` class for handling output
* The `iostream` header file declares an `ostream` variable, or object, called `cout`.
* You must account for the `std` namespace;
* You can use `cout` with the `<<` operator to read a variety of data  types.

File output parallels this very closely:

* You must include the `fstream` header file
* The `fstream` header file defines an `ofstream` class for handling output
* You need to declare one or more `ofstream` variables, or objects, which you can name as you please, as long as you respect the usual naming conventions.
* You must account for the `std` namespace
* You need to associate a specific `ofstream` object with a specific fiel; one way to do so is to use the `open()` method.
* When you've finished with a file, you should use the `close()` method to close the file.
* You can use an `ofstream` object with the `<<` operator to output a variety of data types.

Note that although the `iostream` header file provides a predefined `ostream` object called `cout`, you have to declare your own `ofstream` object:

```
ofstream outFile;
ofstream fout;
```

Here's how you can associate the objects with particular files:

```
outFile.open("fish.txt");
char filename[50];
cin >> filename;
fout.open(filename);
```

Note that the `open()` method **requires a C-style string as its argument.** This can be a literal string or a string stored in an array.

Here's how you can use these objects:

```
double wt = 125.8;
outFile << wt;
char line[81] = "Objects are closer than they appear.";
fout << line << endl;
```

The important point is that after you've declared an `ofstream` object and associated it with a file, **you use it exactly as you would use `cout`**. All the operations and methods available to `cout`, are also available to `ofstream` objects.

In short, these are the main steps for using file output:

1. Include the `fstream` header file.
2. Create an `ofstream` object.
3. Associate the `ofstream` object with a file
4. Use the `ofstream` object in the same manner you would use `cout`.
5. Close it if necessary.

Listing 6.15 demonstrates this approach.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>					// for file I/O

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;

	char automobile[50];
	int year;
	double a_price;
	double d_price;

	ofstream outFile;				// create object for output
	outFile.open("carinfo.txt");	// associate with a file

	cout << "Enter the make and model of automobile: ";
	cin.getline(automobile, 50);
	cout << "Enter the model year: ";
	cin >> year;
	cout << "Enter the original asking price: ";
	cin >> a_price;
	d_price = 0.913 * a_price;

// display information on screen with cout
	
	cout << fixed;
	cout.precision(2);
	cout.setf(ios_base::showpoint);
	cout << "Make and model: " << automobile << endl;
	cout "Year: " << year << endl;
	cout << "Was asking $" << a_price << endl;
	cout << "Now asking $" << d_price << endl;

// now do exact same things using outFile instead of cout
	
	outFile << fixed;
	outFile.precision(2);
	outFile.setf(ios_base::showpoint);
	outFile << "Make and model: " << automobile << endl;
	outFile << "Year: " << year << endl;
	outFile << "Was asking $" << a_price << endl;
	outFile << "Now asking $" << d_price << endl;

	outFile.close();
	return 0;
}
```

When you open an existing file for output, by default it is truncated to a length of zero bytes, so the contents are lost. If you file does not exist, the `open()` method creates a brand new file.

### Reading from a Text File

Text file input is based on console input, which has many elements. Let's begin with a summary of those elements:

* You must include the `iostream` header file
* The `iostream` headerfile defines an `istream` class for handling input.
* The `iostream` header file declares an `istream` variable, or object, called `cin`.
* You must account for the `std` namespace
* You can use `cin` with the `>>` operator to read a variety of data types.
* You can use `cin` with `get()` method to read individual characters and with the `getline()` method to read a line of characters at a time.
* You can use `cin` with methods such as `eof()` and `fail()` to monitor the success of an input attempt.
* The object `cin` itself, when used as a test condition, is converted to the `bool` value `true` if the last read attempty succeeded and to `false` otherwise.

File input parallels this very closely:

* You must include the `fstream` header file
* The `fstream` headerfile defines an `ifstream` class for handling input.
* You need to declare one or more `ifstream` variables, or objects.
* You must account for the `std` namespace
* You need to associate a specific `ifstream` object with a specific file. You way to do so is to use the `open()` method.
* When you've finished with a file, you should use the `close()` method to close the file.
* You can use an `ifstream` object with the `>>` operator to read a variety of data types.
* You can use an `ifstream` object with `get()` method to read individual characters and with the `getline()` method to read a line of characters at a time.
* You can use an `ifstream` object with methods such as `eof()` and `fail()` to monitor the success of an input attempt.
* An `ifstream` object itself, when used as a test condition, is converted to the `bool` value `true` if the last read attempty succeeded and to `false` otherwise.

Here's how you declare such objects:

```
ifstream inFile;
ifstream fin;
```

Here's how you can associate them with particular files:

```
inFile.open("bowling.txt");
char filename[50];
cin >> filename;
fin.open(filename);
```

Note that the `open()` method **requires a C-style string as its arugment**.

Here's how you can use these objects:

```
double wt;
inFile >> wt;
char line[81];
fin.getline(line, 81);
```

The important point is that after you've declare an `ifstream` object and associate it with a file, you can use it exactly as you would use `cin`.

One difference happends when you attempt to open a non-existent file for input. **This error cause subseqent attempts to use the `ifstream` object for input to fail.**. The preferred way to check whether a file was opened successfully is to use the `is_open()` method like this:

```
inFile.open("bowling.txt");
if (!inFile.is_openn())
{
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

You will need the `cstdlib` library.

You can use the older `good()` method instead. But as Chapter 17 discusses, `good()` doesn't check quite as extensively as `is_open()` for possible problems.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>				// file I/O support
#include <cstdlib>				// support for exit()
const int SIZE = 60;
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char filename[SIZE];
	ifstream inFile;
	cout << "Enter name of data file: ";
	cin.getline(filename, SIZE);
	inFile.open(filename);
	if (!inFile.is_open())
	{
		cout << "Could not open the file " << filename << endl;
		cout << "Program terminating.\n";
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
	double value;
	double sum = 0.0;
	int count = 0;

	inFile >> value;
	while (inFile.good())	// while input good and not at EOF
	{
		++count;
		sum += value;
		inFile >> value;
	}
	if (inFile.eof())
		cout << "End of file reached.\n";
	else if (inFile.fail())
		cout << "Input terminated by data mismatch.\n";
	else
		cout << "Input terminated for unknown reason.\n";
	if (count == 0)
		cout << "No data processed.\n";
	else
	{
		cout << "Item read: " << count << endl;
		cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
		cout << "Average: " << sum / count << endl;
	}
	inFile.close();
	return 0;
}
```

You need to pay close attention to the proper design of a file-reading loop. There are several things to test when reading from a file:

1. The file should not try to read past the EOF. The `eof()` method returns `true` if the most recent attempt to read data ran into the EOF.
2. The program might encounter a type mismatch. This program expects a file containing only numbers. `fail()` can be used to test this, but it also return `true` if the EOF is encountered.
3. Something unexpected may go wrong. The `bad()` method returns `true` in this case.

Rather than test for these conditions individually, **it's simpler to use the `good()` method**, which returns `true` if **nothing went wrong.**:

```
while (inFile.good())
{
	...
}
```

Then you can use other methods to determine exactly why the loop terminated.

It's particular important that you understand that `good()` reports on the most recent attempt to read input. That means there should be an attempty to read input **immediately before applying the test**:

```
inFile >> value;
while(inFile.good())
{
	// loop body
	inFile >> value;
}
```

You can condense this somewhat by using the fact that **the following expression evaluates to `inFile` and that `inFile`, when placed in a context in which a `bool` value is expected, evaluates to `inFile.good()`:**

```
inFile >> value;
```

Thus you can write things like this:

```
while (inFile >> value)
{
	// loop body
}
```
