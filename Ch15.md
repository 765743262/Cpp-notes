# Chapter 15 Friends, Exceptions, and More

In this chapter you'll learn about the following:

* Friend classes
* Friend class methods
* Nested classes
* Throwing exceptions, `try` blocks, and `catch` blocks
* Exception classes
* Runtime type identification (RTTI)
* `dynamic_cast` and `typeid`
* `static_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`

## Friends

A class also can be a friend. In that case, any method of the friend class can access private and protected members of the original class. Also you can be more restrictive and designate just particular member functions of a class to be friends to another class. 

A class defines which functions, member functions, or classes are friends; friendship cannot by imposed from the outside.

### Friend Classes

Suppose you must program a simple simulation of a television and a remote control. You decide to define a `Tv` class representing a television and a `Remote` class representing a remote control. Clearly, there should be some sort of relationship between these classes. What is true is that a remote control can modify the state of a television, and this suggests making the `Remote` class a friend to the `Tv` class.

You can represent a televion with a set of members. And you must provide the class with methods for altering the settings, without a remote control. And a remote control should duplicate the controls built in to the television. In addition, a remote control typically provides random access channel selection.

These considerations suggest a definition like that shown in Listing 15.1. The following statement makes `Remote` a friend class:

```C++
friend class Remote;
```

A friend declaration can appear in a public, private, or protected section; the location makes no difference.

```C++
// Listing 15.1
#ifndef TEST_HPP_
#define TEST_HPP_
class Tv
{
public:
	friend class Remote; // Remote can access Tv private parts
	enum {Off, On};
	enum {MinVal, MaxVal = 20};
	enum {Antenna, Cable};
	enum {TV, DVD};

	Tv(int s = Off, int mc = 125)
		: state(s), volume(5), maxchannel(mc),
		  channel(2), mode(Cable), input(TV) {}
	void onoff() { state = (state == On)? Off : On; }
	bool ison() const { return state == On; }
	bool volup();
	bool voldown();
	void chanup();
	void chandown();
	void set_mode() { mode = (mode == Antenna) ? Cable : Antenna; }
	void set_input() { input = (input == TV) ? DVD : TV; }
	void settings() const; // display all settins
private:
	int state;			// on or off
	int volume;			// assumed to be digitized
	int maxchannel;		// maximum number of channels
	int channel;		// current channel setting
	int mode;			// broadcast or cable
	int input;			// TV or DVD
};

class Remote
{
public:
	Remote(int m = Tv::TV) : mode(m) {}
	bool volup(Tv & t) { return t.volup(); }
	bool voldown(Tv & t) { return t.voldown(); }
	void onoff(Tv & t) { t.onoff(); }
	void chanup(Tv & t) { t.chanup(); }
	void chandown(Tv & t) { t.chandown(); }
	void set_chan(Tv & t, int c) { t.channel = c; }
	void set_mode(Tv & t) {t.set_mode(); }
	void set_input(Tv & t) { t.set_input(); }
private:
	int mode;		// controls TV or DVD
};
#endif
```

Note that each `Remote` method other than the constructor takes a reference to a `Tv` object as an argument. This reflects that a remote has to be **aimed at a particular TV**. Listing 15.2 shows the remaining definitions.

```C++
// Listing 15.2
#include <iostream>
#include "test.hpp"

bool Tv::volup()
{
	if (volume < MaxVal)
	{
		volume++;
		return true;
	}
	else
		return false;
}

bool Tv::voldown()
{
	if (volume > MinVal)
	{
		volume--;
		return true;
	}
	else
		return false;
}

void Tv::chanup()
{
	if (channel < maxchannel)
        channel++;
	else
		channel = 1;
}

void Tv::chandown()
{
	if (channel > 1)
		channel--;
	else
		channel = maxchannel;
}

void Tv::settings() const
{
	using std::cout;
	using std::endl;
	cout << "TV is " << (state == Off? "Off" : "On") << endl;
	if (state == On)
	{
		cout << "Volume setting = " << volume << endl;
		cout << "Channel setting = " << channel << endl;
		cout << "Mode = "
			 << (mode == Antenna? "antenna" : "cable") << endl;
		cout << "Input = "
			 << (input == TV ? "TV" : "DVD") << endl;
	}
	
}
```

Listing 15.3 is a short program that tests some of the features of the program so far. The same controller is used to control two separate televisions.

```C++
// Listing 15.3
#include <iostream>
#include "test.hpp"

int main()
{
	using std::cout;
	Tv s42;
    cout << "Initial settings for 42\" TV:\n";
	s42.settings();
	s42.onoff();
	s42.chanup();
	cout << "\nAdjusted settings for 42\" TV:\n";
	s42.settings();

	Remote grey;

	grey.set_chan(s42, 10);
	grey.volup(s42);
	grey.volup(s42);
	cout << "\n42\" settings after using remote:\n";
	s42.settings();

	Tv s58(Tv::On);
	s58.set_mode();
	grey.set_chan(s58, 28);
	cout << "\n58\" settings:\n";
	s58.settings();
	return 0;
}
```

The main point to this exercise is that class friendship is a natural idiom in which to express some relationships. Without some form of friendship, you would either have to make the private parts of the `Tv` class public or else construct some awkward, larger class that encompasses both a television and a remote control. And that solution wouldn't reflect the fact that **a single remote control can be used with several televisions**.

### Friend Member Functions

Looking at the code for the last example, you may notice that most of the `Remote` methods are implemented by using the public interface for the `Tv` class. Indeed, the only `Remote` method that accesses a private `Tv` member directly is `Remote::set_chan()`, so that's the only methods that needs to be a friend. You do have the option of making just selected class members friends to another class rather than making the entire class a friend, but you need to be careful about the order in which you arrange the various declarations and definitions. Let's look at why.

The way to make `Remote::set_chan()` a friend to the `Tv` class is to declare it as a friend in the `Tv` class declaration:

```C++
class Tv
{
	friend void Remote::set_chan(Tv & t, int c);
	...
};
```

However, for the compiler to process this statement, it needs to have already seen the `Remote` definition. This suggests putting the `Remote` definition above the `Tv` definition. But the fact that `Remote` methods mention `Tv` objects means that the `Tv` definition should appear above the `Remote` definition. Part of the way around the circular dependence is to use a _forward declaration_. To do so, you insert the following statement above the `Remote` definition:

```C++
class Tv;	// forward declaration
```

This provides the following arrangement:

```C++
class Tv;
class Remote {...};
class Tv {...};
```

Could you use the following statement instead?

```C++
class Remote;
class Tv {...};
class Remote {...};
```

The answer is no. The reason, as mentioned earlier, is that when the compiler sees that a `Remote` method is declared as a friend in the `TV` class declaration, the compiler needs to have already viewed the declaration of the `Remote` class in general and of the `set_chan()` methods in particular. The forward declaration provides information no more than that the name `Remote` is a class.

Another difficulty remains. In Listing 15.1, the `Remote` declaration contains inline code such as the following:

```C++
void onoff(Tv & t) { t.onoff(); }
```

Because this calls a `Tv` method, the compiler needs to have seen the `Tv` class declaration at this point. But as you've seen, that declaration necessarily follows the `Remote` declaration. The solution to this problem is to restrict `Remote` to method _declarations_ and to place the actual _definitions_ after the `Tv` class. This leads to the following ordering:

```C++
class Tv;			// forward declaration
class Remote {...};	// Tv-using methods as prototypes only
class Tv {...};
// put Remote method definitions here
```

The `Remote` prototypes look like this:

```C++
void onoff(Tv & t);
```

All the compiler needs to know when inspecting this prototype is that `Tv` is a class, and the forward declaration supplies that information. By the time the compiler reaches the actual method definitions, it has already read the `Tv` class declaration. By using the `inline` keyword in the method definitions, you can still make the methods inline methods. Listing 15.4 shows the revised header file.

```C++
#ifndef TEST_HPP_
#define TEST_HPP_


class Tv;	// forward declaration

class Remote
{
public:
	enum State{Off, On};
	enum {MinVal, MaxVal = 20};
	enum {Antenna, Cable};
	enum {TV, DVD};
private:
	int mode;
public:
	Remote(int m = TV) : mode(m) {}
	bool volup(Tv & t);	// prototype only
	bool voldown(Tv & t);
	void onoff(Tv & t);
	void chanup(Tv & t);
	void chandown(Tv & t);
	void set_mode(Tv & t);
	void set_input(Tv & t);
	void set_chan(Tv & t, int c);
};

class Tv
{
public:
	friend void Remote::set_chan(Tv & t, int c);
	enum State{Off, On};
	enum {MinVal, MaxVal = 20};
	enum {Antenna, Cable};
	enum{TV, DVD};

	Tv(int s = Off, int mc = 125) : state(s), volume(5),
		maxchannel(mc), channel(2), mode(Cable), input(TV) {}
	void onoff() {state = (state == On)? Off : On;}
	bool ison() const {return state == On;}
	bool volup();
    bool voldown();
	void chanup();
	void chandown();
	void set_mode() { mode = (mode == Antenna) ? Cable : Antenna; }
	void set_input() {input = (input == TV)? DVD : TV; }
	void settings() const;
private:
	int state;
	int volume;
    int channel;
	int maxchannel;
	int mode;
	int input;
};

// Remote methods as inline functions
inline bool Remote::volup(Tv & t) { return t.volup(); }
inline bool Remote::voldown(Tv & t) { return t.voldown();}
inline void Remote::onoff(Tv & t) { t.onoff(); }
inline void Remote::chanup(Tv & t) { t.chanup(); }
inline void Remote::chandown(Tv & t) { t.chandown(); }
inline void Remote::set_mode(Tv & t) { t.set_mode(); }
inline void Remote::set_input(Tv & t) { t.set_input(); }
inline void Remote::set_chan(Tv & t, int c) { t.channel = c; }

#endif
```

Recall that inline functions have internal linkage so the inline definitions are in the header file.

By the way, making the entire `Remote` class a friend doesn't need a forward declaration because the friend statement itself identifies `Remote` as a class:

```C++
friend class Remote;
```

### Other Friendly Relationships

Let's consdier mutual friendship. For example, an interactive remote control unit might let you enter a response to some question posed on a television program, and the televison might activate a buzzer in your remote control if your response is wrong. This can be accomplished by making the classes friends to each other. One point to keep in mind is that a `Tv` method that uses a `Remote` object can be prototyped _before_ the `Remote` class declaration but must be defined _after_ the declaration so that the compiler will have enough information to compile the method. The setup will look like this:

```C++
class Tv
{
	friend class Remote;
public:
	void buzz(Remote & r);
	...
};

class Remote
{
	friend class Tv;
public:
	void Bool volup(Tv & t) { t.volup(); }
	...
};

inline void Tv::buzz(Remote & r)
{
	...
}
```

Because the `Remote` declaration follows the `Tv` declaration, `Remote::volup()` can be defined in the class declaration. However, the `Tv::buzz()` method has to be defiend outside the `Tv` declaration so that the definition can follow the `Remote` declaration.

### Shared Friends

Another use for friends is when a function needs to access private data in two separate classes. Suppose, for example, that you have a `Probe` class that represents some sort of programmable measuring device and an `Analyzer` class that represents some sort of programmable analyzing device. Each has an internal clock, and you would like to be able to synchronize the two clocks. You could use something along the following lines:

```C++
class Analyzer;		// forward declaration
class Probe
{
	friend void sync(Analyzer & a, const Probe & p);	// sync a to p
	friend void sync(Probe & p, const Analyzer & a);	   // sync p to a
};

class Analyzer
{
	friend void sync(Analyzer & a, const Probe & p);	// sync a to p
	friend void sync(Probe & p, const Analyzer & a);	   // sync p to a
	...
};


// define the friend functions
inline void sync(Analyzer & a, const Probe & p)
{
	...
}
inline void sync(Probe & p, cosnt Analyzer & a)
{
	...
}
```

The forward declaration enables the compiler to know that `Analyzer` is a type when it reaches the friend declarations in the `Probe` class declaration.
