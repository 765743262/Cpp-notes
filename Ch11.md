# Chapter 11 Working with Classes

In this chapter you will learn about the following:

* Operator overloading
* Friend functions
* Overloading the  `<<` operator for output
* State members
* Using `rand()` to generate random values
* Automatic conversions and type casts for classes
* Class conversion functions

## Operator Overloading

_Operator overloading_ is an example of C++ polymorphism.

C++ lets you to extend operator overloading to user-defined types. The compiler **uses the number and type of operands to determine which definition of addition to use**.

You can define a class that represents arrays and that overloads the `+` operator so that you can do this:

```C++
evening = sam + janet;
```

The simple addition conceals the mechanics and emphasizes **what is essential**.

To overload an operator, you use a speicial function form called an _operator function_. **An operator function has the following form, where `_op_` is the symbol being overloaded**:

``` C++
opearator_op_(argument-list)
```

For example, `operator+()` overloads the `+` operator. **The `op` has to be valid C++ operator; you can't just make up a new symbol like @**. But the `operator[]()` function  would overload the `[]` operator because `[]` is the array-indexing operator.

Suppose you define an `operator+()` member function, then statement like

```C++
district2 = sid + sara;
```

may be replaced by

```C++
district2 = sid.operator+(sara);
```

## Time on Our Hands: Devoloping an Operator Overloading Example

Suppose you need a class to perform time addtion, you may have the following class declaration and method definition:

Listing 11.2


``` C++
class Time
{
private:
	int hours;
	int minutes;
public:
	Time();
	Time(int h, int m = 0);
	
	Time Sum(const Time & t) const;
	Time operator+(const Time & t) const;
	void Show() const;
};

Time::Time()
{
	hours = minutes = 0;
}

// default values should not occur here
Time::Time(int h, int m)
{
	hours = h;
	minutes = m;
}

// Time Time::Sum(const Time & t) const
Time Time::operator+(const Time & t) const
{
	Time sum;
	sum.minutes = minutes + t.minutes;
	sum.hours = hours + t.hours + sum.minutes / 60;
	sum.minutes %= 60;
	return sum;
}

void Time::Show() const
{
	std::cout << hours << " hours, " << minutes << " minutes";
}
```

Note we define a regular method version  `Time Sum(const Time & t) const` and an TIme operator version `Time operator+(const Time & t) const`. **Both these functions have exactly same pass-by-value return type, one argument, and the same code**.

Note the return type eas `Time` rather than `Time &` because **`sum` object is a local variable and is destroyed when the function terminates**. Using a `Time` return type means the program constructs a _copy_ of `sum` before destroying it.

You can invoke the `operator+()` method by using the same syntax that `Sum()` uses:

```C++
total = coding.operator+(fixing);
```

or use operator notation

```C++
total = coding + fixing;
```

Note that with the operator notation, **the object to the left of the operator is the invoking object and the object to the right is the one passed as an argument.**

The compiler uses the operand types to figure out what to do:

```C++
int a, b, c;
Time A, B, C;
c = a + b;
C = A + B;
```

You can add more than two objects:

```C++
t4 = t1 + t2 + t3;
```

**In this case, the statement is translated into**:

```C++
t1.operator+(t2.operator+(t2));
```

### Overloading Restrications

Overloaded operator (with some exceptions) **don't necessarily have to be member functions**. However, **at least one operands has to be a user-defined type**. Let's take a closer look at the limits:

* You can't create new operator symbols like `**`.
* The overloaded operator must have at least one operand that is user-defined type.
* You can't use an operator in a manner that violates the syntax rules for the original operator. For example, **you can't overload the modulus operator (%) so that it can be used with a single operand**.
* You cannot overload the following operators:

  ```C++
  sizeof
  .
  .*
  ::
  ?:
  typeid
  const_cast
  dynamic_cast
  reinterpre_cast
  static_cast
  ```

* Most of the operators in Table 11.1 can be overloaded by using **either member or nonmember functions**. However, you can use **_only_ member functions to overload the following operators**:

  ```C++
  =
  ()
  []
  ->
  ```

  Table 11.1 is omiited.

In addition to these formal restrictions, you should use sensible retraint in overloading operators. For example, you shouldn't use * operator so that is swaps the data member of two  `Time` object. Nothing in the notation would suggest what the operator did, so it would better to define a class method with an explanotory name such as `Swap()`.

### More Overloaded Operators

We introduce subtraction and multiplication by a factor:

```C++
Time operator-(const Time & t) const;
Time operator*(double n) const;

Time Time::operator-(const Time & t) const
{
	Time diff;
	int tot1, tot2;
	tot1 = t.minutes + 60 * t.hours;
	tot2 = minutes + 60 * hours;
	diff.minutes = (tot2 - tot1) % 60;
	diff.hours = (tot2 - tot1) / 60;
	return diff;
}
Time Time::operator*(double n) const
{
	Time result;
	long totalminutes = hours * mult * 60 + minutes * mult;
	result.hours = totalminutes / 60;
	result.minutes = totalminutes % 60;
	return result;
}
```

## Introducing Friends

Friends comes in three varieties:

* Friend functions
* Friend classes
* Friend member functions

By makeing a function **a friend to a class**, you allow the function the same access privileges that a member function of the class has. We will only look at the friend functions in this chapter.

The overloaded multiplication operator is that it combines two different types. That cause a problem. You cannont handle the following statement:

```C++
A = 2.75 * B;
```

`2.75` is not a type `Time` object. The compiler cannot replace the expression with a member function call.

One way around this difficulty is to tell everyone that you can onle write `B * 2.75`. This is a **server-friendly, cliend-beware** solution, and that's not what OOP is about.

Because operators can be overloaded using either member of nonmember functions, we consider using a nonmember function:

```C++
Time operator*(double m, const Time & t);
```

This will make the left operand the first argument of the operator function and the right operand the second argument of the function. But it raises a new problem: **nonmember functions can't directly access private data in a class.** There is a special catagory of nonmember functions, called _friends_, that can access private members of a class.

### Creating Friends

* Step 1: Place a prototype **in the class declaration and prefix the declaration with the keyword `friend`:

  ```C++
  friend Time operator*(double m, const Time & t);
  ```

  The prototype has two implications:

  * Although the `operator*()` function is declare in the class declaration, **it is not a member function and isn't invoked by using the membership operator**.
  * Although the `operator*()` functions is not a member function, **it has the same access rights as a member function.**

* Step 2: Write the function definition. Because it is not a member function, **you don't use the `Time::` qulifier**. Also **you don't use the keyword `friend`:

  ```C++
  Time operator*(double m, const Time & t)
  {
      Time result;
      long totalminutes = t.hours * mult * 60 + t.minutes * mult;
      result.hours = totalminutes / 60;
      result.minutes = totalminutes % 60;
      return result;
  }
  ```

With this declaration and definition, the statement:

```C++
A = 2.75 * B;
```

translates to the following:

```C++
A = operator*(2.74, B);
```

In short, **a friend function to a class is a nonmember function that has the same access right as a membe function.**

The friends function doesn't deviate from the OOP approach because only a class declaration can decide which functions are friends, so the class declaration still controls which functions access private data. In short, **class methods and friends are simply two different mechanisms for expressing a class interface**.

Actually, you can write this particular friend function as a non-friend function:

```C++
Time operator*(double m, const Time & t)
{
	return t * m;
}
```

There are reasons two make this version a friend:

* A friend version ties the function in as part of the official class interface.
* If you later find a need for the function to access private data, you only have to alter the definition rather than the prototype.

### A Common Kind of Friend: Overloading the << Operator

You can overloaded the `<<` operator so that you can use it with cout to display an object's contents like:

```C++
cout << trip;
```

Actually << is already heavily overloaded. `ostream` class includes an overloaded `operator<<()` definition for each of the basic types.

One way to teach `cout` to recognize a `Time` object is to add a new function operator definition to the `ostream` class declaration. But that's a dangerous idea. Instead, use the `Time` class declaration to teach the `Time` class how to use `cout`.

#### The First Version of Overloading <<

To teach the `Time` class to use `cout`, **you must use a friend function**. That's because if you use a `Time` member function to overload <<, **the `Time` object would come first. That means you would have to sue the << operator this way:

```C++
trip << cout
```

which is confusing.

By using a friend function, you can overloaded the operator this way:

```C++
void operator<<(ostream & os, const Time & t)
{
	os << t.hours << " hours, " << t.minutes << " minutes";
}
```

This lets you use

```C++
cout << trip;
```

> ##### Friend or No Friend?
> You should note that `operator<<()` function is a friend to the `Time` class but not a friend to the `ostream` class. That's because it accessed individual members of the `Time` object but only uses the `ostream` object as a whole. It accesses private `Time` object members directly, but it does not directly access private `ostream` object members.

Note that the function **must use the `ostream` reference `os` as its first argument. Because it needs to manipulate the object itself rather that a copy. The second argument is reference for efficiency.
