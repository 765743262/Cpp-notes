# Chapter 1 Getting Started with C++

## C and C++

C++ joins three seperate programming categories: 
* the procedual language, represented by C
* the object-oriented language represented by the **class** enhancements C++ adds to C
* the generic programming, supported by C++ **templates**

C's design facilitates **structed programming** and **top-down** design. The structured programming techniques reflect a procedual mind-set, thinking of a program in terms of **the actions** it performs.

Unlike procedual programming, which emphasize algorithms, OOP emphsizes the data. Rather than try to fit a problem to the procedual approach of a language, OOP attempts to **fit the language to the problem**. The idea is to **design data forms** that correspond to the **essential features of the problem**.

The OOP approach to program is to first design classes the accurately represent those things with which the program deals. The process of going from a lower level of organization, such as classees, to a higher level, such as program design, is called **bottom-up** programming.

OOP emphasizes the data aspect of programming, generic programming emphasizes **independence from a particular data type**.

## Portability and Standards

If you can recompile the program without making changes and it runs without a hitch, we say the program is **portable**.

## The Mechanics of Creating a Program

1. Use a text editor to create the **source code** for your program
2. Compile the source code, which means running a program tha translate the source code to the internal language, called **machine language**. The fiel containing the translated program is the **object code** for you program.
3. Link the object code with additional code, which may include
	* library object code for the functions you use
	* some standard startup code
The file containing the final product is called the **executable code**.
