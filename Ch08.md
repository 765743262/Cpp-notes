## Inline Functions

The difference between normal and inline functions is how compiler incorporates them:

* Normal functions:

	The program will jump to the function's address and then jump back.

	This includes:

	* Reach call
	* Stores memory address of instructions *following* the call
	* **Copy function arguments** to the stacks
	* Jump to the address of function and execute
	* Jump back.

* Inline functions:
	
	The compiler put the compiled code in the program. So we do not need to jump back and forth.

**A disavantage:**

Comes with a memory penalty if an inline function is called at several locations.

To use inline, you must take at least two actions:

* Preface the function declaration with the keyword inline
* Preface the function definition with the keyword inline.

C's macros are not real functions. **Always** convert a macro to an inline function if you can.

## Reference Variables

"**Reference**" is a type. So "**reference variable**" makes sense.

The main use is as a formal argument.

** Declaration:
		
		int rats;
		int & rodents = rats;
