# Chapter 4 Compound Types

In this chapter you'll learn about the following:

* Creating and using `string`-class strings
* Using the `getline()` and `get()` methods for reading strings
* Mixing string and numeric input
* Managing dynamic memory with `new` and `delete`
* Creating dynamic arrays, structures
* Automatic, static, and dynamic storage
* The `vector` and `array` classes

## Introducing Arrays

### C++11 Array Initialization

First, you can drop the `=` sign when initializaing an array:

```
double earnings[4] = {1.2e4, 1.6e4, 1.1e4, 1.7e4};
```

Second, you can use empty braces to set all elements to 0:

```
unsigned int counts[10] = {};
float balances[100] {};
```

Third, list-intialization protects against narrowing:

```c++
long plifs[] = {25, 92, 3.0}	// no allowed
char slifs[4] = {'h', 'i', 1122011, '\0'}	// not allowed
char tlifs[4] = {'h', 'i', 112, '\0'} 		// allowed
```

The first initialization fails because converting from a floating-point type to an integer type is narrowing, even if the floating-point value has only zeros after the decimal point. The second initialization fails because 1122011 is outside the range of a `char`. The third succeeds because, **even though 112 is an `int` value, it still is in the range of a `char`.**

## Strings

A **string** is a series of characters stored in consecutive bytes of memory. C++ has two ways of dealing with strings. The first, taken from C and often called a C-style string, is the first one this chapter examines. Later, this chapter discusses an alternative method based on a `string` class library.

### Concatenating String Literals
Any two strings constants separated only by whitespace are automatically joined into one, without any spaces added to the joined strings:

```
cout << "I'd give my right arm to be"
" a great violinist.\n";
```

### Adventure in String Input

```
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	const int ArSize = 20;
	char name[ArSize];
	char dessert[ArSize];

	cout << "Enter your name:\n";
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Enter your favorite dessert:\n";
	cin >> dessert;
	cout << "I have some delicious " << dessert;
	cout << " for you, " << name << ".\n";
	return 0;
}
```

This programs shows have `cin` handles string input. The `cin` technique is to use whitespace to delineate a string. **It reads a word at a time.**

### Reading String Input a Line at a Time

For the `istream` class, of which `cin` is an example, has some line-oriented class member functions: `getline()` and `get()`. Both read an entire input line. However, `getline()` then discards the newline character, whereas `get()` leaves it in the **input queue**. Let's look at the details.

Both methods does **not** save the newline character. They either discard it, or leave it in the input queue.

#### Line-Oriented Input with `getline()`

You invoke this method by using `cin.getline()` as a function call. The function takes two arguments. The first argument is the name of the target, and the second is a limit on the number of characters, including the null character. If this limit is, say, 20, the function reads no more that 19 character, leaving room to automatically add the null character at the end. If a newline character is reached, it stops reading and discard that newline character.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	const int ArSize = 20;
	char name[ArSize];
	char dessert[ArSize];

	cout << "Enter your name:\n";
	cin.getline(name, ArSize);
	cout << "Enter your favorite dessert:\n";
	cin.getline(dessert, ArSize);
	cout << "I have some delicious " << dessert;
	cout << " for you, " << name << ".\n";
	return 0;
}
```

It reads input through the newline character marking the end of the line, but it **doesn't** save the newline character and just discard it.

#### Line-Oriented Input with `get()`

The `istream` class has another member function, `get()`, which comes in several variations. One variant workds like `getline()`. It takes the same argument, interprets them the same way, and reads to the end of a line. But rather than read and discard the newline character, `get()` **leaves that character in the input queue.** Suppose you use two calls to `get()` in a row:

```
cin.get(name, ArSize);
cin.get(dessert, ArSize);	// a problem
```

Because the first call leaves the newline character in the input queue, that newline character is the first character the second call sees, and it it will conclude that it:s reached the end of lien without having found anything to read. Without help, **`get()` just can't get past that newline character.**

There is a help in the form of a variation of `get()`. The call `cin.get()` (**with no argumetns**) reads the single next character, even if it is a newline:

```
cin.get(name, ArSize);
cin.get();
cin.get(dessert, ArSize);
```

Another way to use `get()` is to **concatenate**, or joint, the two class member functions, as follows:

```
cin.get(name, ArSize).get();
```

What makes this possible is that **`cin.get(name, ArSize)` returns the `cin` object**, which is then used as the object that invokes the `get()` function. Similarly, the following function call is possible:

```
cin.getline(name1, ArSize).getline(name2, ArSize);
```

Listing 4.5 uses concatanation.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	const int ArSize = 20;
	char name[ArSize];
	char dessert[ArSize];

	cout << "Enter your name:\n";
	cin.get(name, ArSize).get();
	cout << "Enter your favorite desser:\n";
	cin.get(dessert, ArSize).get();
	cout << "I have some delicious " << dessert;
	cout << " for you, " << name << ".\n";
	return 0;
}
```

One thing to note is how C++ allows multiple versions of functions, **provided that they have different argument lists.** This is called **function overloading**.

Why use `get()` instead of `getline()` at all? First, older implementations may not have `getline()`. Second, `get()` lets you be a bit more carefule. It allows you to inspect whether the whole line has been read, by check the last character in the input queue. This is impossible with `getline()`, which discard the newline character.

#### Empty Lines and Other Problems

What happens after `getline()` and `get()` reads an empty line? The original pratice was that the next input statement picked up where the last `getline()` and `get()` left off. However, the current practice is that **after `get()` (but not `getline()`) reads an empty line, it sets the _failbit_**. The implications of this act are that further input is blocked, but you can restore input with the following command:

```
cin.clear();
```

Another potential problem is that the input string could be longer that the allocated space. In this case `getline()` will sets the failbit and turns off further input.

### Mixing String and Numeric Input

Mixing numeric input with line-oriented string input can cause problems. Consider the simple program in Listing 4.6.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "What year was your house built?\n";
	int year;
	cin >> year;
	cout << "What is its street address?\n";
	char address[80];
	cin.getline(address, 80);
	cout << "Year built: " << year << endl;
	cout << "Address: " << address << endl;
	cout << "Done!\n";
	return 0;
}
```

You never get the opportunity to enter the address. The problem is that when `cin` reads the year, it leaves the newline in the input queue. The `cin.getline()` reads the newline as an empty line and assigns a null string to the address array. This can be fixed using `get()` with no arguments:

```
cin >> year;
cin.get();
```

or 

```
(cin >> year).get();
```

This makes use of the fact that `cin >> year` returns the `cin` object.

## Introducing the `string` Class

The ISO/ANSI C++98 Standard expanded the C++ library by adding a `string` class. Now you can use a type `string` object to hold a string.

To use the `string` class, a program has to include the `string` header file. The `string` class is **part of the `std` namespace**, so you have to provide a `using` directive or declaration or else refer to the class as `std::string`. Listing 4.7 demonstrates some of the similarities and differences between `string` objects and character arrays.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(void)
{
    using namespace std;
    char charr1[20];
    char charr2[20];
    string str1;        // create an empty string object
    string str2 = "panther"; // create an initialized string
    
    cout << "Enter a kind of feline: ";
    cin >> charr1;
    cout << "Enter another kind of feline: ";
    cin >> str1;        // use cin for input
    cout << "Here are some felines:\n";
    cout << charr1 << " " << charr2 << " "
    << str1 << " " << str2  // use cout for output
    << endl;
    cout << "The third letter in " << charr2 << " is "
    << charr2[2] << endl;
    cout << "The third letter in " << str2 << " is "
    << str2[2] << endl;    //use array notation
    return 0;
    
}
```

You should learn from thsi example that, in many ways, you can use a string object in the same manner as a character array:

* You can initlialize a `string` object to a C-style string.
* You can use `cin` to store keyboard input in a `string` object.
* You can use `cout` to display a `string` object
* You can use array notation to **access indicvidual characters** stored in a `string` object.

The main difference between `string` objects and character arrays shown in Listing 4.7 is that you declare a `string` object as a simple variable, **not as an array**:

```
string str1;				//create an empty string object
string str2 = "panther";	// create an initialized string
```

The class design allows the program to **handle the sizing automatically**. For instance, the declaration for `str1` creates a `string` object of length zero, but the program automatically resizes `str1` when it reads input into `str1`:

```
cin >> str1;
```

### C++11 String Initialization

As you might expect by now, C++11 enables list-initialization for C-style strings and `string` objects:

```
char first_date[] = {"Le Chapon Dodu"};
char second_date[] {"The Elegant Plate"};
string third_date = {"The Bread Bowl"};
string fourth_date {"Hank's Fine Eats"};
```

### Assignment, Concatenation, and Appending

The `string` class makes some operations simpler than is the case for arrays. For example, you can assign one string object to another:

```
string str1;
string str2 = "panther";
str1 = str2;
```

You can use the `+` operator to add two `string` objects together and the `+=` operator to tack on a string to the end of an existing `string` object:

```
string str3;
str3 = str1 + str2;
str1 += str2;
```

Listing 4.8 illustrate these usages.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	string s1 = "penguin";
	string s2, s3;

	cout << "You can assign one string object to another: s2 = s1\n";
	s2 = s1;
	cout << "s1: " << s1 << ", s2: " << s2 << endl;
	cout << "You can assign a C-style string to a string object.\n";
	cout << "s2 = \"buzzard\"\n";
	s2 = "buzzard";
	cout << "s2: " << s2 << endl;
	cout << "You can concatenate strings: s3 = s1 + s2\n";
	s3 = s1 + s2;
	cout << "s3: " << s3 << endl;
	cout << "You can append strings.\n";
	s2 += " for a day";
	cout << "s2 += \" for a day \" yields s2 = " << s2 << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

### More `string` Class Operations

Listing 49 compares techniques used with `string` objects with techniques used with character arrays.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char charr1[20];
	char charr2[20] = "jaguar";
	string str1;
	string str2 = "panther";

	str1 = str2;
	strcpy(charr1, charr2);

	str1 += " paste";
	strcat(charr1, " juice");

	int len1 = str1.size();			// obtain length of str1
	int len2 = strlen(charr1);

	cout << "The string " << str1 << " contains " << len1 << " characters.\n";
	cout << "The string " << charr1 << "contains" << len2 << "characters.\n";
	return 0;
}
```

The syntax for working with string objects tends to be simpler than using the C string functions. Futhermore, with arrays, there is always the danger of the destination array being too small to hold the information. The `string` class, with its automatic resizing as necessary, avoids this sort of problem.

Notice the difference syntax used to obtain the number of characters in a string:

```
int len1 = str1.size();
int len2 = strlen(charr1);
```

`size()` is a method from the `string` class. In this particular case, `str1` is a `string` object, and `size()` is a `string` method.

### More on `string` Class I/O

As you've seen, you can use `cin` with the `>>` operator to read a `string` object and `cout` with the `<<` operator to display a `string` object using the same syntax you use with a C-style string. But reading a line at a time instead of a word at a time uses different syntax. Listing 4.10 shows this difference.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring>

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	char charr[20];
	string str;

	cout << "Length of string in charr before input: "
		 << strlen(charr) << endl;
	cout << "Length of string in str before input: "
		 << str.size() << endl;
	cout << "Enter a line of text:\n";
	cin.getline(charr, 20);
	cout << "You entered: " << charr << endl;
	cout << "Enter another line of text:\n";
	getline(cin, str);
	cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;
	cout << "Length of string in charr after input:"
		 << strlen(charr) << endl;
	cout << "Length of string in str after input:"
		 << str.size() << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Note that the length of the string in `str` before input is 0. That's because an uninitialized `string` object is automatically set to zero size.

This is the code for reading a line tinto a `string` object:

```
getline(cin, str);
```

There is not dot notation, which indicates that this `getline()` is not a class method. So it takes `cin` as an argument that tells it where to find the input. Also there is not an argument for the size of the string because the `string` object automatically resizes to fit the string.

The `istream` class was part of C++ long before the `string` class was added, so there is no `istream` class methods for processing `string` objects. But you might wonder why code like this works:

```
cin >> str;
```

It turns out that code like the following does use a member function of the `istream` class:

```
cin >> x; // x is a basic C++ type variable
```

But the `string` class equivalent uses a **friend function** of the `string` class. This is will be examined in Chapter 11.

### Other Forms of String Literals

One C++11 addition is the raw string. In a raw string, characters simply stand for themselves. For example, the sequence `\n` is not interpreted as the newline character; insead, it is two ordinary characters. On the other hand, if you press the Enter or Return key while typing a raw string, that not only moves the cursor to the next line onscree, it also places a carriage return character in the raw string.

Raw strings use "( and )" as delimiters, and they use an R prefix to identify them as raw strings:

```
cout << R"(Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl)" << '\n';
```

You can insert any characters between " and (:

```
cout << R"+*("(Who wouldn't?)", she whispered.)+*" << endl;
```

## Introducing Structures

A structure is a user-defined type:

```
struct inflatable
{
	char name[20];
	float volume;
	double price;
};
```

The identifier `inflatable` is the name, or **tag** of the structure. Each individual item in the list is called a structure **member**.  After you have defined the structure, you can create variables of that type:

```
inflatable hat;
inflateble mainframe;
```

**Note unlike C, C++ allows you to drop the keyword `struct` when you declare structure variables.** In C++, the structure tag is used just like a fundamental type name. This change emphasizes that a strucure declaration defines a new type.

You use the **membership operator** (.) to access individual members.

Listing 4.11 illustrates some points about a structure.

```
#include <iostream>
struct inflatable
{
	char name[20];
	float volume;
	double price;
};

int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	inflatable guest =
	{
		"Glorious Gloria",
		1.88,
		29.99
	};
	inflatable pal = 
	{
		"Audacious Arthur",
		3.12,
		32.99
	};

	cout << "Expand your guest list with " << guest.name;
	cout << " and " << pal.name << "!\n";
	cout << "You can have both for $";
	cout << guest.price + pal.price << "!\n";
	return 0;
}
```

Here the structure definition is placed outside of `main()`. This is called an **external declaration**. C++ practices discourage the use of external variables but encourage the use of external structure declarations. Also it often makes sense to declare symbolic constants externally.

### C++11 Structure Initialization

As with arrays, C++11 extends the features of list-initialization. The `=` sign is optional

```
inflatable duck {"Daphne", 0.12, 9.98};
```

Empty braces result in the individual members being set to 0:

```
inflatable mayor {}
```

Finally, narrowing is not allowed.

### Can a Structure Use a `string` Class Member?

You can. But you need to make sure the structure definition has access to the `std` namespace. You can do this by moving the `using` directive so that it is above the structure definition. The better choice is add prefix `std::` explicitly:

```
#include <string>
struct inflatable
{
	std::string name;
	float volume;
	double price;
};
```

## Enumerations

Consider the following statement:

```
enum spectrum {red, orange, yellow, gree, blue, violet, indigo, ultraviolet};
```

This statement does two things:
* It makes `spectrum` the name of a new type; `spectrum` is termed an `enumeration`, much as a `struct` variable is called a structure.
* It establishes `red`, `orange`,`yellow`, and so on, as symbolic constants for the integer values 0--7. These constants are called **enumerators**.

**The only valid value that you can assign to an enumeration variable without a type cast are the enumerator values used in defining the type. Only the assignment operator is defined for enumerations**. In particular, arithmetic operations are not defined+

```
spectrum band;
++band;						// not valid
band = orange + red;		// not valid, but a little tricky
```

Enumerators are of integer type and can be promoted to type `int`, but the reverse is not true. In the second third statement, `orange` and `red` are promoted to `int`, for which addition is defined. But the result cannot by assigned to `band`.

### Value Ranges for Enumerations

Refer to the text.

## Pointers and the Free Store

Listing 4.15 demonstrates the use of pointers in C++

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	int updates = 6;
	int * p_updates;

	p_updates = &updates;

	cout << "Values: updates = " << updates;
	cout << ", *p_updates = " << *p_updates << endl;

	cout << "Addresses: &updates = " << &updates;
	cout << ", p_updates = " << p_updates << endl;

	*p_updates = *p_updates +1;
	cout << "Now updates = " << updates << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

As you can see, you can display the value of a pointer using `cout`.

### Pointer Danger

**Pointer Golden Rule**: Always initialize a pointer to a definite and appropiate address before you apply the dereferencing operator (`*`) to it.

### Pointers and Numbers

Pointers and integer types are distinct types. C+++ enforces type agreement. The following code will cause the compiler to give you an error message:

```
int * pt;
pt = 0xB8000000;
```

You need an explicit type cast.

### Allocating Memory with `new`

Object-oriented programming differs from traditional procedual programming in that OOP emphsizes making decisions during runtime instead of during compile time. So for, you've initialize pointers to the addresses of variables. These variables are **named** memory allocated during compile time, and each opinter merely provides an alias for memory you could access. The true worth of pointers comes into play when you allocate **unnamed** memory during runtime to hold values. In this case, pointers become the **only access** to that memory. C++ provides the `new` operator for doing this.

You tell `new` for what data type you want memory; `new` finds a block of memory of the correct size and returns the address of the block. You assign this addresss to a pointer:

```
int * pn = new int;
```

Compare this with assigning the address of a variable to a pointer:

```
int higgens;
int * pt = &higgens;
```

In both cases, you assign the address of an `int` to a pointer. In the second case, you case also access the `int` by name: `higgens`. In the first case, **your only access is the pointer**.

We say that `pn` points to a **data object**. This is not "object" in the sense of OOP; it's just "object" in the sense of "thing". The term "data object" is more general than the term "varaible" because it means any block of memory allocated for a data item. Thus, **a variable is also a data object**, but the memory to which `pn` points is not a variable.

The general form for obtaining and assigning memory for a single data object is:

```
typeName * pointer_name = new typeName;
```

You use the data type twice: once to specify the kind of memory requested and once to declare a suitable pointer. Listing 4.17 illustrates using `new` with two different types.

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;

	int nights = 1001;
	int * pt = new int;
	*pt = 1001;
	cout << "nights value = ";
	cout << nights << " location = " << &nights << endl;
	cout << "int ";
	cout << "value = " << *pt << " location = " << pt << endl;

	double * pd = new double;
	*pd = 10000001.0;

	cout << "double ";
	cout << "value = " << *pd << ": location = " << pd << endl;
	cout << "location of pointer pd: " << &pd << endl;
	cout << "size of pt = " << sizeof(pt);
	cout << ": size of *pt = " << sizeof(*pt) << endl;
	cout << "size of pd = " << sizeof pd;
	cout << ": size of *pd = " << sizeof(*pd) << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

The program uses `new` to allocate memory for the type `int` and type `double` **data objects**. This occurs when the program is running. The pointers `pt` and `pd` point to these two **data objects**. Without them, you cannot access those memory locations.

Another point to note is that typically `new` uses a different block of memory than do the ordinary variable definitions that we have been using. Both the varaibles `nights` and `pd` have their values stored in a memory region called the **stack**, whereas the memory allocated by `new` is in a region called the **heap** or **free store**. Chapter 9 discusses this a bit further.

### Freeing Memory with `delete`

The `delete` operator enables you to return memory to the memory pool when you finished with it. You use `delete` by following it with a pointer to a block of memory originally allocated with `new`:

```
int * ps = new int;
...
delete ps;
```

You should not attempt to free a block of memory that you have previously freed. Also you cannot use `delete` to free memory created by declaring ordinary varaible.

Note: You use `delete` only to free memory allocated with `new`. However, it is safe to apply `delete` to a null pointer.

Note that the critial requirement for using `delete` is to use it with memory allocated by `new`. **This doesn't mean you have to use the same pointer you used with `new`; instead, you have to use the same address:**

```
int * ps = new int;
int *pq = ps;
delete pq;			// valid
```

### Using `new` to Create Dynamic Arrays

Typically, you use `new` with large chunks of data, such as arrays, strings, and structures. This is where `new` is useful.

Suppose, for example, you're writing a program that might or might not need array, depending on information given to the program while it is running. One choice is to create an array by declaring it. Allocating the array during compile time is called **static binding**. There are two implications:

* The space is allocated when the program is compiled, even if you don't really need it later.
* The size of the array must be specified when you write the program.

But with `new`, you can create an array during runtime if you need it and **skip creating the array if you don't need it**. On the other hand, you can select the array size after the program is running. This is called **dynamic binding**, meaning that the array is created while the program is running. Such an array is called a **dynamic array**.

For now, we'll look at two basic matters concerning dynamic arrays: how to use C++'s `new` operator to create an array and how to use a pointer to access array elements.

#### Creating a Dynamic Arrays with `new`

It's easy to create a dynamic array in C++; you tell `new` the type of array element and number of elements you want:

```
int * psome = new int [10];		// get a block of 10 ints
```

The `new` operator returns the address of the **first element** of the block. In this example, that value is assigned to the poiner `psome`.

As always, you should balance the call to `new` with a call to `delete` when the program finishes using that bock of memory. However, using `new` with brackets to create an array requires using an alternative form of `delete` when freeing the array:

```
delete [] psome;
```

**The presence of the brackets tells the program that it should free the whole array, not just the element pointed by the pointer**. The effect of mismatching `new` and `delete` forms is undefined:

```
int * pt = new int;
short * ps = new short [500];
delete [] pt;		// effect is undefined, don't do it
delete ps;			// effect is undefined, don't do it
```

In short, you should observe these rules when you use `new` and `delete`:

* Don't use `delete` to free memory that `new` didn't allocate
* Don't use `delete` to free the same block of memory twice in succession
* Use `delete []` if you used `new []` to allocate an array
* Use `delete` (no brackets) if you used `new` to allocate a single entity.
* It's safe to apply `delete` to the null pointer

Now let's return to the dynamic array. Note that `psome` is a pointer to a single `int`, the first element of the block. **It's your responsibility to keep track of how many elements are in the block**. 

Actually, the program does keep track of the amount of memory allocated so that the `delete []` operator can work correctly. But that information isn's publicly available. **You can't use the `sizeof` operator** to find the number of bytes in a dynamically allocated array.

The general form for allocating and assigning memory for an array is this:

```
typeName * pointer_name = new type_name [num_elements];
```

#### Using a Dynamic Array

Listing 4.18 shows how you can use `new` to create a dynamic array and then use array notation to access the elements. 

```
#include <iostream>
int main(void)
{
	using namespace std;
	double * p3 = new double [3];
	p3[0] = 0.2;
	p3[1] = 0.5;
	p3[2] = 0.8;
	cout << "p3[1] is " << p3[1] << ".\n";
	p3 = p3 + 1;
	cout << "Now p3[0] is " << p3[0] << " and ";
	cout << "p3[1] is " << p3[1] << ".\n";
	p3 = p3 - 1;
	delete [] p3;
	return 0;
}
```

### Pointers and Strings

All C-style strings are actually handles with the type pointer-to-`char`. Normally, if you give `cout` a pointer, it prints and address. But if the pointer is type `char *`, `cout` displays the pointed to string. If you want to see the address of the string, you have to type cast the pointer to another pointer type, such as `int *`.

### Using `new` to Create Dynamic Structures

The `new` operator can be used to create dynamic structures. Again, **dynamic** means the memory is allocated during runtime, not at compile time. You can use the following:

```
inflatable * ps = new inflatable;
```

Note that the syntax is exactly the same as it is for C++'s built-in types.

Listing 4.21 uses `new` to create an unnamed structure.

```
#include <iostream>
struct inflatable
{
    char name[20];
    float volume;
    double price;
};

int main(void)
{
    using namespace std;
    inflatable * ps = new inflatable;
    cout << "Enter name of inflatable item: ";
    cin.get(ps->name, 20);
    cout << "Enter volume in cubic feet: ";
    cin >> ps->volume;
    cout << "Enter price: $";
    cin >> ps->price;
    cout << "Name: " << ps->name << endl;
    cout << "Volume: " << ps->volume << " cubic feet\n";
    cout << "Price: $" << ps->price << endl;
    delete ps;
    return 0;
}
```

#### An Example of Using `new` and `delete`

Let's look at an example that uses `new` and `delete` to manage storing string input from the keyboard.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
char * getname(void);
int main(void)
{
	char * name;

	name = getname();
	cout << name << " at " << (int *) name << endl;
	delete [] name;

	name = getname();
	cout << name << " at " << (int *) name << endl;
	delete [] name;
	return 0;
}

char * getname()
{
	char temp[80];
	cout << "Enter last name: ";
	cin >> temp;
	char * pn = new char [strlen(temp) + 1];
	strcpy(pn, temp);
	return pn;
}
```

Function `getname()` uses `cin` to place an input word into the `temp` array. Next, it uses `new` to allocate new memory to hold the word. Including the null character, the program needs `strlen(temp) + 1` characters to store the string, so that's the value given to `new`.

Note in this example that `getname()` allocates memory and `main()` frees it. It's usually not a good idea to put `new` and `delete` in separate functions because that makes it easier to forget to use `delete`. But this example does separate them just to show that it is possible

### Automatic Storage, Static Storage, and Dynamic Storage

#### Automatic Storage

Ordinary variables defined inside a function use **automatic storage** and are called **automatic variables**. These terms mean that the variables come into existence automatically when the function containing them is invoked, and they expire when the function terminates.

Automatic variables typically are stored on a **stack**.

#### Static Storage

Static storage is storage that exists throughout the execution of an entire program. There are two ways to make a variable static. One is to define it externally, outside any funcions. The other is to use the keyword `static` when declaring a variable:

```
static double fee = 56.50;
```

#### Dynamic Storage

The `new` and `delete` operators provide a more flexible approach that automatic and static variables. They manage a pool of memory, which C++ refers to as the **free store** or **heap**. This pool is separated from the memory used for static and automatic variables.

## Array Alternatives

Earlier this chapter mentioned the `vector` and `array` **template class** alternatives to the built-in array. Let's take a brief look now at how they are used and at some of the benefits of using them.

### The `vector` Template Class

The `vector` template class is similar to the `string` class in that **it is a dynamic array**. You can set the size of a `vector` object during runtime, and you can append new data to the end or iinsert new data in the middle. Basically, it's an alternative to using `new` to create a dynamic array. Actually, the `vector` class does use `new` and `delete` to manage memory, but it does so automatically.

We'll look at a few basic pratical matters:
1. To use a `vector` object, you need to include the `vecotr` header file;
2. The `vector` identifier is part of the `std` namespace, so you can use a `using` directive, a `using` declaration, or `std::vector`.
3. Templates use a different syntax to indicate the type of data stored.
4. The `vector` class uses a different syntax to indicate the number of elements. Here are some examples:

```
#include <vecotr>
...
using namespace std;
vector<int> vi;			// create an zero-size array of int
int n;
cin >> n;				
vector<double> vd(n);	// create an array of n doubles	
```

We say that **`vi` is an object of type `vector<int>` and that `vd` is an object of type `vector<double>`.** Because `vector` objects resize automatically when you insert or add values to them, it's okay for `vi` to start with 0 size. But for the resizing to work, you would use the various methods that are part of the `vector` package.

In general, the following declaration creates a `vector` object `vt` that can hold `n_elem` elements of type `typeName`:

```
vector<typeName> vt(n_elem);
```

### The `array` Template Class(C++11)

C++11 adds the `array` template class, which is part of the `std` namespace. Like the built-in type, an array object has an **fixed size** and uses the stack instead of the free store. The syntax is a bit different from that for a vector:

```
#include <array>
...
using namespace std;
array<int, 5> ai;
array<double, 4> ad = {1.2, 2.1, 3.43, 4.3};
```

More general, the following declaration creates an `array` object `arr` with `n_elem` elements of `typeName`:

```
array<typeName, n_elem> arr;
```

Unlike the case for vector, `n_elem` can't be a variable.

With C++11, you can use list-initialization with `vector` and `array` objects. However, that was not an option with C++98 `vector` objects.
