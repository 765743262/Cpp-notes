# Chapter 7 Functions: C++'s Programming Modules

ANSI C borrowed prototyping from C++, but the two languages fo have some differences. The most important is that ANSI C, to preserve compatibility with classic C, make prototyping optional, where as C++ makes prototyping mandatory.

Prototyping produces automatic type casts to the expected types.

## Function Arguments and Passing by Value

C++ normally passes arguments **by value**. That means the numeric value of the argument is passed to the function, **where it is assigned to a new variable**.

## Functions and Arrays

## Showing the Array and Protecting it with `const`

Unless the purpose of a function is to alter data passed to it, you should safeguard it from doing so. That protection comes automatically with ordinary arguments because C++ passes them by value, and the function works with a copy. But to keep a function from accidentally altering the contents of an array argument, you should use the keyword `const`:

```
void show_array(const double arr[], int n);
```

The declaration states that the pointer `arr` points to constant data.

### Pointers and `const`

You can assign the address of either `const` data or non-`const` data to a ointer-to-`const`, provided that the data type is not itself a pointer, but you can assign the address of non-`const` data only to a non-`const` pointer.

You should declare formal pointer arguments as pointers to `const` whenever it's appropiate. There are two strong reasons for doint that:

* It protects you against programming errors that inadventently alter data.
* Using `const` allows a function to process both `const` and non-`const` actual arguments, whereas a function that omits `const` in the prototype can accept only non-`const` data.

## Functions and C-Style Strings

The standard way to process the characters in a string is:

```
while (*str)
{
	statements
	str++;
}
```

## Functions and Structures

You can pass structures by value. The disadvantage is that the space and effort involved in making a copy of a structure can increase memory  requirements and slow down the system. 

Many C programmers prefer passing the address of a structure and then using a pointer to access the structure contents. C++ provides a third alternative, called **passing by reference**, that is discussed in Chapter 8. 

## Functions and `string` Class Objects

Although C-style strings and `string` class objects serve much the same purpose, a `string` class object is more closely related to a structure that to an array. You can pass an object as a complete entity. If you need several strings, you can declare a one-dimensional array of `string`.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
const int Size = 5;
void display(const string sa[], int n);
int main(void)
{
	string list[Size];
	cout << "Enter your " << Size << " favorite astronomical sights:\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < Size; i++)
	{
		cout << i + 1 << ": ";
		getline(cin, list[i]);
	}

	cout << "Your list:\n";
	display(list, Size);

	return 0;
}

void display(const string sa[], int n)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cout << i + 1 << ": " << sa[i] << endl;
}
```

## Functions and `array` Objects

You can pass an object by value to a function. Alternatively, you can pass a pointer to an object. Suppose we have an `array` object intended to hold expenses figures for each of the four seasons of the year:

```
std::array<double, 4> expenses;
```

If we want a function to display the contents of `expenses`, we can pass `expenses` by value:

```
show(expenses);
```

But if we want a function that modifies the `expenses` object, we need to pass the address of the object to the function:

```
fill(&expenses);
```

The function prototypes will look like:

```
void show(std::array<double, 4> da);
void fill(std::array<double, 4> * pa);
```

The program adds a few more features. First, it replaces `4` with a symbolic constant:

```
const int Seasons = 4;
```

Second, it adds a `const array` object containing four `string` objects representing four seasons:

```
const std::array<std::string, Seasons> Snames =
	{"Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter"};
```

```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <string>

const int Seasons = 4;
const std::array<std::string, Seasons> Snames =
	{"Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter"};
void fill(std::array<double, Seasons> * pa);
void show(std::array<double, Seasons> da);

int main(void)
{
	std::array<double, Seasons> expenses;
	fill(&expenses);
	show(expenses);
	return 0;
}

void fill(std::array<double, Seasons> * pa)
{
	using namespace std;
	for (int i = 0; i < Seasons; i++)
	{
		cout << "Enter " << Snames[i] << " expenses: ";
		cin >> (*pa)[i];
	}
}

void show(std::array<double, Seasons> da)
{
	using namespace std;
	double total = 0.0;
	cout << "\nEXPENSES\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < Seasons; i++)
	{
		cout << Snames[i] << ": $" << da[i] << endl;
		total += da[i];
	}
	cout << "Total Expenses: $" << total << endl;
}
```

Both `fill()` and `show()` have drawbacks. For `show()`, the problem is that `expenses` holds four `double` values and it's inefficient to create a new object of that size and to copy the `expenses` values into it. The `fill()` function avoids this inefficiency by using a pointer. But this comes at the cost of notation that makes the programming look more complicated.

Using references, as discussed in Chapter 8, helps solve both the efficiency and the notational problems.
