## Seperate Compilation

### Headers

The original program can be divided into three parts:

* A header file that contains structure declarations and prototypes
* A source code file that contains the code for the **structure-related functions**
* A source code file that contains the code that calls the structure-related fucntions

**Note you cannot put definition in the header** because if the header is included in two files that are part of a single program, you'd wind up with an error. **But structure definition and prototypes can be included several times.**

A standard header file includes:

* Symbolic constants defined using `#define` or `const`
* Structure declarations
* Class declarations
* Template declarations
* Function prototypes
* Inline functions

Structure declarations, template declarations, const and inline functions can be placed in header files without causing problems. Only things that create a new entity will cause problems.

### Multiple Library Linking 

C++ Standard allows each compiler designer the latitude to implement name decoration. So the **binary modules (object-code files)** created with different compilers will look different, and thus may not link properly. 

When attempting to link compiled modules, you should make sure that **each object file or library was generated  with the same compiler**.

## Storage Duration, Scope, and Linkage

### Storage Durations

There are three seperate schemes for storing data (four under C++11):

* Automatic stoage duration:

  Variables declared inside a funciton definition including parameters.

* Static storage duration:

  Variables outside a function definition or else by using the keyword `static`.

* Dynamic storage duration:

  Memory allocated by the `new` operator and freed with the `delete` operator. This memory is sometimes termed _free store_ or the _heap_.

* Thread storage duration (C++11)

### Scope and Linkage

**Scope: visibility in a tranlation unit**

* Local/block scope
* Global scope
* Function prototype scope
* Class scope
* Namespace scope

The global scope has become a special case of namespace scope.

**Linkage: how a name can be shared in different units**

* Internal linkage
* External linkage

**Functions cannot have local scope.**

### Automatic Storage Duration

**Automatic  variable is allocated when execution enters the block, but the scope begins only after the point of declaration.**

In C and prior versions of C++ auto is used to explicitly identify a variable as having aotomatic storage. But in C++11, the usage is **no longer valid** and introduce a new one.


#### Register Variables

Keyword `register` is originally used to speed up access to a variable. But in C++11, it left as just a way to explicitly identify a varaible as being automatic.

### Static Duration Variables

C++ provide static storage duration variables with three kinds of linkage: 

* External linkage: accessable across files
* Internal linkage: accessible to functions within a single file
* No linkage: accessible to just one function or one block

Variables declare outside any block have **external linkage** naturally.

```
int global = 1000; // static duration, external linkage
static int one_file = 50; // static duration, internal linkage
```


All unintialized static variable has all its bits set to 0, or _zero-initialized_.

#### Initializing Static Variables.

* _Static initialization_: initialization happends at compile-time. This includes z_ero-initialization and _constant expression initialization_.

* _Dynamic initialization_:
  initialization performed at running time. Like:

```
const double pi = 4.0 * atan(1.0);
```

First of all, **all static variables are zero-initialized**. Next, if the variable is initialized using a constant expression that the compiler can evaluate, it performs constant-expression. If there's not enough information at this time, the variable will be dynamically initialized.

### Static Duration, External Linkage

Variables with external linkage are often referred to as _external variables_. They **necessarily** have static storage duration and file scope. They are also termed _global variables_,

#### One Definition Rule (odr)

To use external variable in other functions, you MUST use a _referencing declaration_. But _defining declaration_ can only appear once.

A _referencing declaration uses keyword _extern_ and **does not provide initialization** like

```
extern int blem;
```


This means we are refer to a variable defined in another tranlation unit.

C++ offers _scope-resolution operator_(::). Normally, variables with no linkage will hide its global version.
By using _scope-resolution operator(::)_

```
	::warning
```

You mean specifically to use the global version of warning

### Static Duration, Internal Linkage

The difference between internal linkage and external linkage becomes meaningful in multifile program. In that context, a variable with internal linkage is local to the file that contains it.

If a file declares a static external variable that has the same name as an ordinary external variable declared in another file, **the static version is the one in scope for that file**:

``` 
// file 1
int error = 20;
...

// file 2
static int error = 5;	// known to file2 only
```

> **Note**
> In a multifile program, you can define an external variable in one and only one file. All other files using that variable have to declare that variable with the `extern` keywork.

### Static Storage Duration, No Linkage

### Specifiers and Qualifiers

Certain keywords, called _storage class specifiers_ and _cv-qualifiers_, provide additional information about storage.

Storage class specifiers:

```
register
static
extern
thread_local // C++11
mutable
```
Cv-qualifiers

```
const
volatile
```

`cv` stands for const and volatile.

`volatile` is used to indicated that this variable may be changed not by this program, and thus prevent some optimization.

`Mutable` is used to indicate a particular member of a structure or class can be altered even if a particular structure of class is a const.

```
struct data
{
	char name[30];
	mutable int accesses;
};
const data = {...}
veep.accesses++; // allowed
```

#### More about const

In C++ (but not C), the `const` modifier alters the default storage classes slightly. Whereas a global variable has external linkage by default, **a const global variable has internal linkage by default**. That is, C++ treats a global `const` definition, such as in the following code fragment, as if `const` specifier had been used:

```
const int fingers = 10;
int main(void)
{
	...
}
```


Then `fingers` can only be used in this file.

**Because of this, you can place const variables in the header files.**

But if you want a constant to have external linkage, you can prefix the declaration with `extern` like

```
extern const int states = 50;
```

When you declare a `const` within a function or block, it has block scope, which means the constant is usable only the n the program is executing code within the block.

### Functions and Linkage

Like variables, functions have linkage properties.

All functions automatically have static storage duration. **Functions have external linkage**. You can use extern to indicate the function is defined in another file, but unlike variables, this is **optional**.

You can use the keyword `static` to give a function internal linkage, confining its use to a single file. As with variables, a static function containing a static function overrides an external definition.

The one definition rule extends to non-inline functions, too. Therefore, **every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function.** 

Inline functions are excepted from this rule to allow you to place inline function definitions in a header file. However, C++ does require that all the inline definitions for a particular function be identical.

#### Where C++ Finds Functions

The compilers will looks in all program files, then in the library files.

### Language Linking

### Storage Schemes and Dynamic Allocation

#### Initialization with the new Operator

If you wish to create and initialize storage for one of the scalar built-in types such as `int` and `double`, you can do so by following the desired type with an initialization value enclosed in parentheses:

```
int * pi = new int (6);
double * pd = new double (99.99);
```

To initialize an ordinary structure or an array, **you need C++11 and list initialization using braces**. The new standard allows the following:

```
struct where {double x; double y, double z;};
where * one = new where {2.5, 5.3, 7.2};
int * ar = new int [4] {2, 4, 6, 7};
```

With C++11, you also can use the brace initialization for single-valued variables:

```
int * pin = new int {6};
double * pdo = new double {99.99};
```

#### When `new` Fails

In early days, it just returns a null pointer. Currently, however, `new` throws a `std::bad_alloc` exception. This is in Chapter 15.

#### `new`: Operators, Functions, and Replacement Functions

The new and new[] operaters call upon two functions:

```
void * operator new(std::size_t);
void * operator new[](std::size_t);
```

There are termed _allocation functions_, and they are part of the **global namespaces**. Similarly, there are _deallocation functions_ used by `delete` and `delete[]`:

```
void operator delete(void *);
void operator delete[](void *);
```

They use the operator-overloading syntax discussed in Chapter 11. The `std::size_t` is a `typedef` for some suitable integer type. A basic statement such as:

```
int * pi = new int;
```

gets translated into something like this:

```
int * pi = new(sizeof(int));
```

And the statement

```
int * pa = new int[40];
```

gets tranlated into something like this:

```
int * pa = new(40 * sizeof(int));
```

Similarly,

```
delete pi;
```

invokes the following function call:

```
delete(pi);
```

Interestingly, C++ terms these functions _replaceable_. That means **you can supply replacement functions for `new` and `delete`**. One option, for instance, is to define replacement functions with class scope so that they can be tailored to fit the allocation needs of a particular class. Your code would use the `new` operator as usual, but the `new` operator would call upon the replacement `new()` function.

#### The Placement new Operator

Originally, the `new` operator will find in the heap a block of memery to handle the memory you request. The `new` operator has a variation, called _placement_ `new`, that allows you to specify the location to be used.

To use placement new, you first include the `new` header file, which provides a prototype for this version of `new`. Then you use `new` with an argument that provides the intended address:

```
#include <new>
struct chaff
{
	char dross[20];
	int slag;
};
char buffer1[50];
char buffer2[500];
int main(void)
{
	chaff * p1, * p2;
	int * p3, * p4;
// first, the regular forms of new
	p1 = new chaff;
	p3 = new int [20];
// now, the two forms of placement new
	p2 = new (buffer1) chaff;
	p4 = new (buffer2) int [20];
...
}
```

Actually placement new function does nothing other than **return the address passed to it, type casting it to `void *` so that it can be assign to any pointer type.** It doesn't keep track of whether that location has already been used, and it doesn't search the block for unused memory. You don't need delete to free this memory. Actually you can't.

Another way you can use placement `new` is to combine it with `new` initialization to place information at a specific hardware address.

The default placement `new` seems useless. C++ allows programmers to overload placement `new`. The situation becomes more involved when you use placement `new` with class objects.

#### Other Forms of Placement `new`

Just as regular `new` invokes a new function with one argument, the standard placement new invokes a new funciton with two arguments:

```
int * p2 = new (buffer) int; // invokes new(sizeof(int), buffer);
```
The placement new function is not replaceable, but it can be overloaded. It needs at least two paramters, the first of which always is a `std::size_t` parameter designating the number of bytes requested. Any such overloaded function is termed a placement `new`, even if the additional parameters don't specify a location.

## Namespaces

Names in C++ can refer to variables, functions, structures, enumerations, classes, and class and structure members. When programming projects grow large, the potential for name conflicts increases. For example, two libraries might both define classes named `List`, `Tree` and `Node`, but in incompatible ways. Such conflicts are termed `namespace problems`.

### Tranditional C++ Namespaces

Some terminology:

* _Declarative region_: A declarative region is a region in which declarations can be made. For example, a block, a function, a class, a namespace, etc..

* _Potential scope_: the potential scope for a variable begins at its point of declaration and extends to the end of its  declarative region. It's the largest portion of program text where the name can be used.

* _Scope_: the portion of the program where you can actually access the variable. It doesn't include a block where it's "hidden".

### New Namespaces Features

C++ adds the ability to create **named** namespaces by defining a new kind of declarative region, one whose main purpose it to provide an area in which to declare names. The names in one namespace don't conflict with the same name declared in other namespaces.

The following code, for example, uses the new keywork `namespace` to create two namespaces, `Jack` and `Jill`:

```
namespace Jack
{
	double pail;
	void fetch();
	int pal;
	struct Well { ... };
}

namespace Jill 
{
	double bucket(double n) { ... }
	double fetch;
	int pal;
	struct Hill { ... };
}
```


Namespaces can be located at the global level or inside other namespaces, but they cannot be placed in a block. Thus a name declared in a namespace has **external linkage by default** (unless it refers to a constant).

In addition to user-defined namespaces, there is one more namespace, the _global namespace_. This corresponds to the file-level declarative region. So what used to be termed _global variables_ are now described as being part of the global namespace.

Namespaces are **open**, meaning that you can add names to existing namespace. For example, the following statement adds the same `goose` to the existing list of names in `Jill`:

```
namespace Jill
{
	char * goose(const char *);
}
```

Similarly, the original `Jack` namespace provides a prototype for a `fetch()` function. You can provide the code for the function later in the file (or in another file) by using the `Jack` namespace again:

```
namespace Jack
{
	void fetch(void)
	{
		...
	}
}
```


You can access names in a given namespaces using `::`, the _scope-resolution_ operator to _qualify_ a name with its namespace:

```
Jack::pail = 12.34;
Jill::Hill mole;
Jack::fetch();
```

An unadorned name such as `pail` is termed the _unqulified name_, whereas a name with the namespace, as in `Jack::pail`, is termed a _qualified name_.

#### `using` Declarations and `using` Directives

C++ provides two machanisms, the `using` _declaration_ and the `using` _directive_ to simplify using namespace names. The `using` declaration lets you make particular identifiers available, and the `using` directive makes the entire namespace accessible.

The `using` declaration involves preceding a qualified name with the keyword `using`:

```
using Jill::fetch;
```

A `using` declaration adds a particular name to the **declarative region** in which it occurs. For example, the `using` declaration of `Jill::fetch` in `main()` adds `fetch` to the **declarative region** defined by `main()`. After making this declaration, you can use the name `fetch` instead of `Jill::fetch`. The following code fragment illustrates these points:

```
namespace Jill
{
	double bucket(double n) {...}
	double fetch;
	struct Hill {...};
}
char fetch;
int main(void)
{
	using Jill::fetch;	// put fetch into the block (local declarative region)
	double fetch;		// Error! Already have a local fetch
	cin >> fetch;		// read a value into Jill:fetch
	cin >> ::fetch;		// read a value into global fetch
	...
}
```


Because a `using` declaration adds the name to the local declarative region, this example
**precludes creating another local variable by the name of `fetch`**. Also like any other local variable, **`fetch` would override a global variable by the same name.**

Placing a `using` declaration at the external level **adds the name to the global namespace:**

```
void other();
namespace Jill
{
	double bucket(double n) {...}
	double fetch;
	struct Hill { ... };
}
using Jill::fetch;
int main(void)
{
	cin >> fetch;
	other();
...
}

void other()
{
	cout << fetch;
}
```

A `using` declaration makes a single name available. In contrast, the `using` directive makes **all** the names available without the use of the scope-resolution operator:

```
using namespace Jack;
```

Placing a `using` directive at the global level makes the namespace names available globally. Placing a `using` directive in a particular function makes the names available just in that function:

```
int main()
{
	using namespace jack;
...
}
```

One thing to keep in mind about `using` directives and `using` declarations is that they increase the possibility of name conflicts. If you have both namespace `jack` and `jill` available, and you use the scope-resolution operator, there is no ambiguity:

```
jack::pal = 3;
jill::pal = 10;
```

However, if you employ `using` declaratioins, the situation changes:

```
using jack::pal;
using jill::pal;
pal = 4;			// which one? now have a conflict
```

In fact, the compiler won't let you use both of these `using` declarations because of the ambiguity that would be created.

#### `using` Directives Versus `using` Declarations

Using a `using` directive to import all the names from a namespace wholesale if **not** the same as using multiple `using` declarations. It's more like the mass application of a scope resolution operators.

The following is a possible explanation. First, some facts are given:

* Each declarative region is related to a set of names; these names are the ones that can be used **unqualified** inside the particular region; 
* In a set of name of a declarative region, there can't be two same names.

The following statement introduce new names into a declarative region:

* Regular variable declaration
* `using` declaration

If eithe of them tries to introduce a pre-existing name, it will be an error.

Now, suppose you encounter a unquanlified name in a declarative region, the following things happens:

1. It looks up names in the set of names belongs to the declarative region
2. If no such name exist, it performs qualified name loop-up, which would look for names in the following namespaces:
	1. The global namespace
	2. Namespace specified by the `using` directive
	If two name are found in this case, there will be an error.

Thus, a `using` directive doesn't introduce names into a declarative region, it just provide another option for name look up. See the following example:

```
namespace Jill
{
	double bucket(double n) { ... }
}

char fetch;					// global namespace
int main(void)
{
	using namespace Jill;
	Hill Thrill;				
	double water = bucket(2);	
	double fetch;			// not an error
	cin >> fetch;			// read a value into the local fetch
	cin >> ::fetch;			// read a value into global fetch
	cin >> Jill::fetch;		// read a value into Jill::fetch
	...
}
```

The `using` directive doesn't introduce the name `fetch` into the local scope(declarative region), so the local `fetch` declaration, which introduces the name `fetch` into the block, will not cause an error. In the statement

```
cin >> fetch;
```

The compiler first looks up the name `fetch` in local scope, which is just introduced by `double fetch`. But if the declaration `double fetch` is not present, then because the presence of `using namespace Jill`, the compiler will loop up the name `fetch` in both `Jill` namespace and the global namespace. In this case, two matches are present, and that would be an error.

Generally speaking, the `using` declaration is safer to use than a `using` directive because it shows exactly what names you are making available. And if the name conflicts with a local name, the compiler lets you know. There no unexpected "hiding" cases. The `using` directive adds all names (in a sense), even ones you might not need. If a local name conflicts, it overrides the namespace version, **and you aren't warned**.

Namespace proponents hope that you will be more selective and use either the scope-resolution operator or the `using` declaration. That is, you shouldn't use the following:

```
using namespace std;
```

Instead, you should use this:

```
int x;
std::cin >> x;
std::cout << x << std::endl;
```

Or you could use this:

```
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
int x;
cin >> x;
cout << x << endl;
```

#### More Namespace Features

You can nest namespace declarations, like this:

```
namespace elements
{
	namespace fire
	{
		int flame;
		...
	}
	float water;
}
```

In this case, you can refer to `flame` variable as `elements::fire::flame`. Similarly, you can make the inner names available with this `using` directive:

```
using namespace elements::fire;
```

Also you can use `using` directives and `using` declarations inside namespaces, like this

```
namespace myth
{
	using Jill::fetch;
	using namespace elements;
	using std::cout;
	using std::cin;
}
```

This is equivalent to adding this names to namespace `myth`. Suppose you want to access `Jill::fetch`. Because `Jill::fetch` is now part of the `myth` namespace, where it can be called `fetch`, you can access it this way:

```
std::cin >> math::fetch;
```

Of course, because it is also part of the `Jill` namespace, you still can call it `Jill::fetch`. Or you can do this, **provided no local variables conflict**:

```
using namespace myth;
cin >> fetch;
```

**You can create an alias for a namespace**. For example, suppose you have a namesapce defined as follows:

```
namespace my_very_favorite_things { ... };
```

You can make `mvft` an alias for `my_very_favorite_things` by using the following statement:

```
namespace mvft = my_very_favortie_things;
```

You can use this technique to simplify using nested namespaces:

```
namespace MEF = myth::elements::fire;
using MEF::flame;
```


#### Unnamed Namespaces

You can create an _unnamed namespace_ by omitting the namespace name:

```
namespace
{
	int ice;
	int bandycoot;
}
```

This definition is treated as a definition of a namespace with unique name (that can never be referred to by users) and a `using` directive in the current scope that nominates this unnamed namespace. In other words, `ice` and `bandycoot` are introduced into the current scope.

The real implication is, unnamed namespaces as well as all namespaces declared directly or indirectly within an unnamed namespace have internal linkage, which means that any name that is declared within an unnamed namespace has internal linkage. This provides an alternative to using static variables with internal linkage. Suppose, for example, you can do this:

```
namespace
{
	int counts;
}
int other(void);
int main(void)
{
	...
}
int other(void)
{
	...
}
```

This will be equivalent to using the declaration:

```
static int counts;
```

### A Namespace Example

```
// namesp.h
#include <string>

namespace pers
{
	struct Person
	{
		std::string fname;
		std::string lname;
	};
	void getPerson(Person &);
	void showPerson(const Person &);
}

namespace debts
{
	using namespace pers;
	struct Debt
	{
		Person name;
		double amount;
	};
	void getDebt(Debt &);
	void showDebt(const Debt &);
	double sumDebts(const Debt ar[], int n);
}

```

```
// namesp.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "test.hpp"
namespace pers
{
	using std::cout;
	using std::cin;
	void getPerson(Person & rp)
	{
		cout << "Enter first name: ";
		cin >> rp.fname;
		cout << "Enter last name:";
		cin >> rp.lname;
	}
	void showPerson(const Person & rp)
	{
		std::cout << rp.lname << ", " << rp.fname;
	}
}

namespace debts
{
	void getDebt(Debt & rd)
	{
		getPerson(rd.name);
		std::cout << "Enter debt: ";
		std::cin >> rd.amount;
	}
	void showDebt(const Debt & rd)
	{
		showPerson(rd.name);
		std::cout << ": $" << rd.amount << std::endl;
	}
	double sumDebts(const Debt ar[], int n)
	{
		double total = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			total += ar[i].amount;
		return total;
	}
}
```

```
#include <iostream>
#include "test.hpp"

void other(void);
void another(void);
int main(void)
{
	using debts::Debt;
	using debts::showDebt;
	Debt golf = 
	{
		{"Benny", "Goatsniff"},
		120.0
	};
	showDebt(golf);
	other();
	another();
	return 0;
}

void other(void)
{
	using std::cout;
	using std::endl;
	using namespace debts;
	Person dg = {"Doodles", "Glister"};
	showPerson(dg);
	cout << endl;
	Debt zippy[3];
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
		getDebt(zippy[i]);
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
		showDebt(zippy[i]);
	cout << "Total debt: $" << sumDebts(zippy, 3) << endl;
}

void another(void)
{
	using pers::Person;
	Person collector = {"Milo", "Rightshift"};
	pers::showPerson(collector);
	std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

Note that `using` declarations just use the name; to import a function, you don't need to describe the return type or function signature. Thus, if a function were overloaded, a single `using` declaration would import all the versions.

### Namespaces and the future

As programmers become more familiar with namespaces, common programming idioms will emerge. Here are some guidelines:

* Use variables in a named namespace instead of using external global variables
* Use variables in an unnamed namespace instead of using internal global variables
* If you develop a library of functions or classes, place them in a namespace. Indeed, C++ currently already calls for placing standard library functions in a namespace called `std`. 
* Use the using directive **only as a temporary means of converting old code to namespace usage.**
* Don't use using directives in header files; for one thing, doing so conceals which names are being made available. Also the ordering of header files may affect behavior. If you use a `using` directive, place it after all the preprocessor `#include` directives.
* Preferentially import names by using the scope-resolution operator or a using declaration.
* Preferentially use local scope instead of global scope for using declarations.

Bear in mind that the main motivation for using namespaces is to simplify management of large programming projects.

## Exercises

Standard way to input:

	while (!(std::cin >> c.slag))
	{
	    std::cout << "Please enter a integer.\n";
	    std::cin.clear();
	    while (std::cin.get() != '\n')
	        continue;
	}
	while (std::cin.get() != '\n')
	    continue;
